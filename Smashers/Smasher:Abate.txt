   Abate is a smasher from Pittsburgh and originally from New Jersey who mains Luigi in Melee. Originally a Falco player, he began using Luigi when he counterpicked him against Forward. After taking inspiration from fellow Pittsburgh Luigi player, Vudujin, he has made Luigi his main character.

   Abate has taken sets off of top smashers, including Westballz, Axe, Duck, DruggedFox, S2J, Mike Haze, Hax, n0ne, and Cactuar. His best result was at The Big House 5 (the 5th largest Melee tournament of all time) where he placed 7th. He is currently considered one of the best Melee Luigi players in the world along with Ka-Master.

   Abate is currently ranked 2nd on the Pittsburgh Melee Power Rankings and 63rd on the 2018 MPGR.

   On Dec. 1st, 2017, Abate was sponsored by Knights, becoming their first Smasher and first player overall.
