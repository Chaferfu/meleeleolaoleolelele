Tournament history[[42]edit]

   Amsah entered the Dutch Smash scene in March 2005. After seeing some videos of professional Japanese Sheik player [43]Captain Jack, he claimed to not be impressed by his skills in a now legendary post. Amsah attended [44]Dutch Tournament 10 and played against Captain Jack in friendlies, but was 3-stocked multiple times (including being 3-stocked by Captain Jack's [45]Mr. Game & Watch). Amsah did do surprisingly well in the tournament itself, however, where he took 9th place after losing to [46]Kirby Squad and [47]Marc.

   However, Amsah soon started attending a number of following tournaments, in which he showed that he was making impressive progress. Soon he was able to take on some of the best Dutch players at the time. He finished second at several tournaments, often losing to players such as [48]Remen or Kirby Squad. He won his first tournament, [49]JST4, in July 2005, defeating [50]Utto in grand finals.

   After this, Amsah's skill level skyrocketed and he managed to place higher than Remen at [51]ATM2 in November 2005, thus claiming the title of the best Dutch smasher. However, he didn't play against Remen at any point during the tournament. Amsah finally managed to defeat Remen in tournament in February 2006, winning [52]ATM3 and establishing himself as the best Dutch smasher.

   This was not the end of Amsah's spectacular improvement. In April 2006, he took on Captain Jack again in grand finals at [53]XTC3. Captain Jack still won, though the defeat was significantly closer than at DT10, with Amsah winning the first set of grand finals after coming out of the losers' bracket.

   In the summer of 2006, Amsah traveled to Sweden to attend The Renaissance of Smash 3, where he faced the best Swedish player of the time, [54]Ek. They met in winners' finals, which was a close and intense set. The final match of the set, however, is regarded by many to be one of the greatest matches ever recorded, being one of the greatest comebacks of all time in smash. With the score tied 3-3, Ek managed to gain a two-stock lead whilst only taking 7% damage. Ek soon had a three-stock lead whilst at 140% damage. Amsah managed to start a comeback, taking two stocks off of Ek, though when Ek still had two fresh stocks, Amsah was on his last stock with 108% damage. This made it seem even more impossible to win, though Amsah's smart play allowed him to take Ek to his last stock. After barely surviving some of Ek's moves, Amsah managed to continue his comeback and win the match with 162% damage on his last stock. This became the origin of a popular European expression, 'pulling an Amsah'.
   Afterwards, Amsah defeated Ek once again in grand finals, and won the tournament. Amsah was considered by many to be the best player in Europe after RoS3.

   In December 2006, Amsah got a chance to meet Captain Jack again, at [55]JST5. He lost to Captain Jack in winners' finals, but after eliminating Ek in losers' finals, Amsah managed to win both sets of grand finals against Captain Jack, winning the tournament. In July 2007, Amsah also won [56]The Renaissance of Smash 4, winning both sets of grand finals against [57]Aldwyn. In February 2008, at [58]Epita Smash Arena 2, Amsah defeated Japanese smasher [59]Masashi in winners' semis, and then proceeded to once again defeat Captain Jack in both winners' finals and grand finals.

   Amsah lost his title of the best European smasher in 2009. At [60]SMASH ATTACK in April 2009, Amsah lost to [61]Zgetto in winners' semis, and was then eliminated by [62]Armada 0-4 in losers' finals. Shortly after, at [63]Epita Smash Arena 3, he lost to Armada 0-4 once again in grand finals. After Armada attended [64]GENESIS and placed 2nd, he said that Amsah would have also made it into top 3 if he had attended. Amsah proved this in January 2010, when he attended [65]Pound 4. He managed to defeat top American players such as [66]Jman and [67]Zhu, and even managed to eliminate Armada 3-1 in losers' semis. He was then eliminated by [68]Hungrybox 0-3 in losers' finals. Amsah's losses to Armada in European tournaments remained consistent, however, as he lost to Armada in grand finals 1-4 at Berlin Calling, 0-4 at [69]Epita Smash Arena 4, and 0-4 at [70]B.E.A.S.T. Amsah later attended [71]Pound V and [72]Apex 2012, where he placed 9th and 33rd in Melee singles, respectively.

   Amsah soon became somewhat inactive in the European scene, only showing up to Dutch regional tournaments. He made his first international appearance in more than two years at [73]Republic of Fighters 3, where he placed 9th in Melee singles. He also placed 3rd in doubles with [74]Faab.

Trivia[[214]edit]

     * Throughout his entire [215]Melee career, Amsah's [216]Sheik was notably never 4-stocked by anyone in any tournament match, though after nearly 10 years this streak finally came to an end at [217]B.E.A.S.T 5, when [218]Armada four-stocked his Sheik with [219]Peach during game 2 of their losers' quarters set.
     * Amsah likes to team up with smashers who are far below his own skill level. For instance, he teamed up with his own friend [220]Natta, [221]Linkje and Utto's sister [222]Rinda. These people function as "tank" for Amsah, giving him stocks when he gets KO'd.
     * Due to the similarities of their tags, Amsah and Japanese [223]Yoshi player [224]aMSa played [225]a best of 5 "grudge match" in friendlies at [226]Pound 2016, with Amsah winning 3-2 after several close games.
