   Bizzarro Flame (aka Bizz) is a smasher from La Cañada Flintridge, California currently residing in San Francisco who mains [21]Ganondorf in [22]Melee, and is considered the second best Ganondorf main in the world behind [23]Kage. He first became recognized for his technical gameplay after releasing the Ganondorf [24]tech skill video [25]Ganon on Ice in 2010, and has since then become a solid tournament threat.

   He was formerly ranked 98th on the [26]2015 SSBMRank, 11th on the [27]NorCal Melee Power Rankings, and 18th on the [28]SoCal Melee Power Rankings. He has found good tournament success, taking sets off of even notable [29]Sheik players such as [30]Laijin, and bringing sets against top professionals such as [31]Colbol and [32]Leffen close. At [33]I'm Not Yelling!, Bizzarro Flame [34]took a game off of [35]Armada's [36]Fox, forcing him to counterpick [37]Peach.

   On February 2nd, 2016, Bizzarro Flame announced his retirement from competitive Smash and resignation from [38]Team YP in order to focus on his career as an attorney. 24 days after his retirement, however, he announced on Twitter he would return to competitive Smash, after quitting his job and moving in with his fiancée in San Francisco. On May 28th, 2017, Bizzarro Flame [39]was signed in by Kyoto eSports, alongside [40]Redd and [41]ALP. On January 14th, 2018, Bizzarro revealed in a [42]YouTube video that he signed another one-year contract with them.

Playing style[[50]edit]

   Bizzarro Flame has as an extremely flashy playstyle that revolves around brutal punishes, [51]chaingrabs, and tricky movement, and frequently "disrespecting" opponents with excessive and sub-optimal moves. In addition to his advanced tech, Bizz has also become closely associated with the use of Ganondorf's rarely used up-tilt. His flashy playstyle has led to many infamous moments at tournaments; in particular, he [52]landed four down aerials against [53]Laijin's [54]Sheik in the first game of their pools set at [55]EVO 2013 and finished off the stock with just an up aerial and forward aerial, plus a gratuitous Wizard's Foot spike after Laijin's recovery came up short, and he also [56]landed five down aerials and a forward aerial against [57]Strain's [58]Fox in the second game of their set at [59]Kings of Cali 4, before finishing off his stock by covering his recovery with an up tilt.

   However, such a playstyle has also slightly held Bizzarro Flame back, as against stronger players, his commitment to less optimal approaches and movement can lead to him immediately losing the [60]neutral game. Additionally, he struggles against defensive players, as they can often exploit Ganondorf's inherent weaknesses to camping, and prevent him from landing any attacks that could convert to a punish.

Trivia[[130]edit]

     * At [131]Apex 2015, Bizzarro Flame played a $100 [132]money match against [133]Eikelmann in [134]VGBootCamp's Salty Suite, where he won 3-0. Originally, his opponent was [135]Kage, but due to sickness, he was not able to attend. He and Kage finally had their set at [136]EVO 2015, where he lost 0-5. Despite his Salty Suite match, however, he would team up with him in doubles. They ended up getting 7th place.
