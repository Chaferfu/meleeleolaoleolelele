   Bones is an active smasher in the MD/VA area. He performs well in the VGBootCamp Xanadu series when he shows. He is mostly known for his well-thought-out posts on Smashboards, such as rulesets and theory discussion, and has been on Smashboards since July 2005, gaining respect from many players including RaynEX. More recently, he has entered tournaments under the Melee Hell tag, much to some hosts' chagrin. Bones was ranked 9th on the MD/VA Melee Power Rankings for the August 2017 Season, and as of 2018 is currently unranked.
