Gameplay and tournament activityedit

   An ex-Marth main, Cactuar is now one of the top Fox players in the region. He picked up Fox in 2008 for use in teams and eventually made the switch for singles as well. His smash roots are split between Northern NJ, where he was recruited by the crew "The Smash Affiliates" (TSA), and Philadelphia, where he went to Drexel University. At Drexel, he played with Pakman, who was familiar with the competitive scene and encouraged him to go to competitions in the Tri-State and MD/VA areas.

   Cactuar eventually became a training partner for Mew2King, who lived 20 minutes outside of Philadelphia. Mew2King was determined to become the best Marth, and having a Marth training partner to practice the Marth ditto with became invaluable experience for his ultimate goal of overtaking Ken. The two eventually started teaming, having great success at local tournaments as well as on the national level. Cactuar eventually started taking breaks from the competitive scene, and recommended that Jman take his place.

   Now living in NorCal, Cactuar drifts in and out of the competitive scene, but is always ready to provide advice to anyone who asks for it, whether they are a fresh face to the competitive scene or a top 5 player. He is known for providing solid analysis of player styles, insight into player vs player manipulation, and tips on strengthening both the foundations of play ability and the necessary mindset to play competitively.

Triviaedit

     * Commentators often comment on Cactuar's resemblance to Canadian actor Keanu Reeves, jokingly referring to him as Neo (after the main character in The Matrix, played by Reeves) or Keanu.
