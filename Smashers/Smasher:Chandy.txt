   Chandy is a Donkey Kong main from Austin, Texas. He was listed as a Hidden Boss for SSBM Rank 2017 and is currently ranked 7th on the Austin Melee power rankings. Although he seldom travels outside of Texas, he is considered among the best active Melee Donkey Kong mains.

   Chandy is also credited with discovering several advanced but highly situational techniques involving the use of Link's bombs, documented in comedic fashion on his YouTube channel.

   Chandy's first DK combo video, "BRUTAL", came in third place in the 2015 MIOM combo video contest with an aggregate score of 7.25 out of a possible 10 points. In January 2016 he released his second DK combo video, "BEATDOWN" to critical acclaim on both YouTube and the r/SSBM subreddit.

   He also upset Tafokints and received 33rd place at DreamHack Austin 2017.
