Playstyleedit

   In 2015, Colbol has expressed a dislike to play Fox against other spacies. A prime example of this was at Do You Fox Wit It? when he went 0-5, 1-10 in the Round Robin Fox dittos. Instead, he has developed a Marth to fight Fox and Falco and has found solid success, boasting win records against spacies such as Lucky.

   He does however show great expertise in various matchups such as Captain Falcon, Samus, Luigi, Ice Climbers, and Yoshi typically not losing to any players who play these characters. He has taken sets off of S2J, Wizzrobe, Plup, HugS, Mew2King, ChuDat, Fly Amanita, Silent Wolf, and Hungrybox.
