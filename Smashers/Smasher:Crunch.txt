   Crunch, formerly Captain Crunch, is a Super Smash Bros. Melee Fox main from Florida who currently lives in Orlando, Florida. He is a competent player, having taken sets off of Kage, Vanity Angel, Harriet, and Drunksloth, and placing top 64 at multiple national tournaments such as CEO 2016, Super Smash Con 2016, and Shine 2016. In 2015 he was ranked 8th on the Central Florida Melee Power Rankings. He is currently ranked 2nd on the Maine Melee Power Rankings and 8th on the New England Melee Power Rankings. He is also a hidden boss on the 2015 SSBMRank, has taken a game off of Armada at DreamHack Winter 2016, and a game off Hungrybox at CFL Smackdown 172

   Crunch is mostly known for being the coach of Melee god and Jigglypuff main Hungrybox. Their partnership began after CEO 2015 and Hungrybox's disappointing 5th place finish as a result of losing to Armada and Mango (both using Fox). As a Fox main himself, Crunch gave him tips on how to handle the matchup and helped him fix the flaws in his gameplay in general. His coaching has been highly effective and one of the main causes of Hungrybox's success in 2015 and the beginning of 2016, placing 1st at DreamHack Winter 2015, Battle of the Five Gods, Pound 2016, CEO 2016, and EVO 2016.

   On July 9th, 2016, he was picked up by Team Liquid as an official Smash coach to further improve Hungrybox's gameplay.
