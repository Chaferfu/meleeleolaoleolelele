Informationedit

   DJ Nintendo is widely known as the "voice" of the East Coast Melee scene, a role similar to that of HomeMadeWaffles on the West Coast, as he commentates on tournament livestreams. Being bilingual, DJ Nintendo casted in Spanish for Pound 2016's Melee singles top 8 simulcast, alongside n0ne. DJ Nintendo is also a great mentor or "sensei", as he enjoys helping players improve their games with his accurate and helpful advice; some of his most notable "students", such as Jman and The Moon, have reached widespread notoriety in the Smash community under and beyond his coaching.

   He was also invited to participate in the E3 2014-held Super Smash Bros. Invitational tournament to play Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. He used Bowser in the tournament.

Phrasesedit

   In addition to his commentary, DJ Nintendo uses an overt vocabulary during matches.
     * "No D.I." (said while elongating and exaggerating the "I" sound) - his most popular phrase, which he says when someone fails to optimize directional influence
          + "Drinking his DJs" (when someone DI's really well)
     * "More Coverage than Verizon" - said when a smasher covers most or all of an opponent's options
     * "Presshha!!" - an abstraction of the word pressure
     * "Knee of Love" - used when there is a well spaced knee
     * "Washing Machine" - refers to Peach's down smash
     * "Payless Shoes" - refers to Peach's down aerial, since Peach uses her shoes, which look like they are cheap shoes from a store like Payless.
     * "Papaya Smack" - refers to Samus's forward smash
     * "Construction Boots" - refers to Ganondorf's down aerial, because this move deals heavy damage using Ganondorf's boots.
     * "The Batmobile" - refers to Ganondorf's down special, due to the animation of the move.
     * "Celebrity Legs" - refers to Sheik's back aerial
     * "Ramen Noodles" - refers to when a player quickly edge-hogs an opponent at the last possible moment
     * "Judo Chops" - refers to Luigi's forward aerial
     * "The Splits" - refers to Fox's down smash
     * Some of his nicknames for Mr. Game & Watch's moves:
          + "Metro Card" - forward aerial
          + "Kingdom Hearts" - down aerial
          + "Franklin the Turtle" - back aerial
          + "Take a Seat" - forward tilt
     * "Schlice" - random times
