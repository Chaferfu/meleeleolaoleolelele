Information[[60]edit]

   DJ Nintendo is widely known as the "voice" of the East Coast Melee scene, a role similar to that of [61]HomeMadeWaffles on the West Coast, as he commentates on tournament livestreams. Being bilingual, DJ Nintendo casted in Spanish for [62]Pound 2016's Melee singles top 8 simulcast, alongside [63]n0ne. DJ Nintendo is also a great mentor or "sensei", as he enjoys helping players improve their games with his accurate and helpful advice; some of his most notable "students", such as [64]Jman and [65]The Moon, have reached widespread notoriety in the Smash community under and beyond his coaching.

   He was also invited to participate in the [66]E3 2014-held [67]Super Smash Bros. Invitational tournament to play [68]Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. He used [69]Bowser in the tournament.

Phrases[[70]edit]

   In addition to his commentary, DJ Nintendo uses an overt vocabulary during matches.
     * "No D.I." (said while elongating and exaggerating the "I" sound) - his most popular phrase, which he says when someone fails to optimize [71]directional influence
          + "Drinking his DJs" (when someone DI's really well)
     * "More Coverage than Verizon" - said when a smasher covers most or all of an opponent's options

     * "Knee of Love" - used when there is a well spaced knee
     * "Washing Machine" - refers to Peach's down smash
     * "Payless Shoes" - refers to Peach's down aerial, since Peach uses her shoes, which look like they are cheap shoes from a store like Payless.
     * "Papaya Smack" - refers to Samus's forward smash
     * "Construction Boots" - refers to Ganondorf's down aerial, because this move deals heavy damage using Ganondorf's boots.
