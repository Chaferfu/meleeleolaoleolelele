   DaShizWiz is a top professional [23]Falco player from Florida, considered to be one of the best Falco mains in the world and currently ranked 74th on the [24]2018 MPGR. Influenced by [25]Bombsoldier's videos and by fellow Falco main [26]Lambchops' coaching, he improved very quickly and became very successful in the Melee scene. In his career, he has taken sets off of top players such as [27]Westballz, [28]Swedish Delight, [29]Gahtzu, [30]Hax, [31]ChuDat, [32]Chillin, [33]Abate, and [34]aMSa, and has had very close and intense sets against the best smashers in the world, such as [35]Mango, [36]Dr. PeePee and [37]Mew2King. At [38]FAST 1, he managed to 3-stock and 2-stock Mew2King in tournament; although he ended up losing the set, he only lost to Mew2King by one stock each time. They played again in Losers' Finals at the first [39]Revival of Melee in another intense set, where Mew2King defeated him 3-1. The fourth and final match in particular is one of the most viewed competitive Smash
   videos to date, and is often seen as one of the greatest matches of all time. It can be viewed [40]here

   After a hiatus, Shiz returned to the Melee scene in 2015. His big return to form was with his [41]Paragon Orlando 2015 attendance, where he swept through his pool and garnered himself a solid 25th place finish in the main bracket. This return from hiatus was relatively short-lived due to a number of personal reasons, including some controversial run-ins with the law, which prompted responses from a number of top-players.

   While this was certainly a setback for Shiz, he returned to the Melee scene once again in 2017. While many still have doubts about Shiz and his behavior, he hasn't given anyone reason to worry thus far and has been allowed to compete in major tournaments like [42]EVO 2017, and [43]Too Hot to Handle where he was able to upset [44]Gahtzu and [45]Swedish Delight respectively. While DaShizWiz is not as active as he was before, he does have an active stream and plans to attend more tournaments in the future.
