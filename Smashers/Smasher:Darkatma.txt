   Darkatma, also known as just Atma, is an American Sheik and Peach player with Fox as a secondary. Originally from Fremont, California, he rose to prominence while living in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was regarded as one of the best Midwest players. In 2016 he returned to Northern California, where he continues to compete.

   Darkatma achieved notoriety for taking a game off of Hungrybox at The Big House 3, nearly managing to close out the set afterwards; he ended up placing 7th out of 172 entrants. He is also known for his doubles prowess, boasting impressive placings at a variety of prestigious tournaments with long-time partner Frootloop. His most notable doubles results include a 4th place finish at EVO 2015, and 5th place finishes at both GENESIS 3 and EVO 2016.

   Darkatma is currently ranked 9th on the NorCal Melee Power Rankings and 75th on the 2018 MPGR. He was previously ranked 1st on the Missouri Melee Power Rankings.
