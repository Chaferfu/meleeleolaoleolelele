Biographyedit

   DjaGoF started playing when he lived in Hyères, the same city Fauster was in at the time, before they both moved to Lyon, one of the largest French communities. He started playing as a Yoshi main, and later on he switched to Fox, then to his current main, Captain Falcon. He sometimes still plays Fox in bracket and in doubles. DjaGoF often plays with the in-game tag "Lima", after his girlfriend's hometown.

Playstyleedit

   Over the years, DjaGoF has taken a habit of styling excessively on opponents and going on taunting sprees, sometimes to the expense of his performance, such as at B.E.A.S.T 7, where Nintendude tweeted about "a relentless platform camping Falcon in tourney who taunted 5 times on a platform and then immediately SD'd"^. He is notorious for going crazy combo strings, and has even gone for Falcon Punches.
