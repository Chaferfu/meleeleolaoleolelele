   DoH is one of the best Melee Peach mains from the United States, preferring pink as his color of choice. His style is unusually offensive for a Peach player, preferring to overwhelm his opponents with speed and combos. He also is known for his luck in pulling and ability to wield stitch faces and Bob-ombs. FASTLIKETREE has said about DoH, "crazy crack head offensive Peach should not be that effective." DoH is usually found in either the Debate Hall, Southwest, or Peach forums on Smashboards. He draws his Peach inspiration from Mike G, Armada, Xelic, and Ikki.

   He was previously ranked 100th on the 2015 SSBMRank and 10th on the MD/VA Melee Power Rankings.

   DoH participated in the Smash Panel Power Rankings project during its last installment. Though it came the closest to true national rankings of any other such project, it was finally disbanded after backlash from the community demonstrated that the effort was not appreciated. He also ran the now defunct Texas Power Rankings under the auspices of Dr. DrewTheDragon.
