                        Real name        Drew Scoles
                         Location        Columbus, Ohio  United States

   Drephen is the red-haired member and definitive best-placing member of CoK, Central Ohio Krew. He utilizes a very unconventional style of Sheik, preferring to overwhelm the enemy with down throw tech chases and down smash reads rather than going for technical combos. He is currently ranked 1st on the Columbus Melee Power Rankings and 60th on the 2018 MPGR.

   Drephen was considered one of the elite 5 players in the Midwest in the pre-Brawl era, along with Tink, Dope, Vidjogamer, and Darkrain. The players used to be so close in standing that rarely any of them won consecutive tournaments.

   He notably appeared in the documentary about competitive Melee, The Smash Brothers. Drephen currently resides in Columbus, Ohio.
