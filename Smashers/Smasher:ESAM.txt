Trivia[[636]edit]

     * ESAM is [637]Nick Riddle's younger brother.
     * ESAM is also a top [638]Divekick player. He won the Divekick event at [639]CEO 2014.
     * ESAM sometimes goes by the alias "Mr. Clean", a reference to his bald head.
     * Due to his attitude and tendency to immerse himself in drama, ESAM is seen as a controversial figure in the Smash community. He is well noted for starting confrontations with other players in social media, and for having questionable or unpopular opinions, particularly his insistence on [640]Pikachu being one of the best characters in [641]SSB4. The latter point has also started a meme in the Smash community as "#ESAMOpinions", being used to refer to any stance that is not widely shared.
          + Ironically enough, he sometimes uses said hashtag to denote how his opinion might not be widely shared in its entirety.
          + He also has a noted tendency to have his opinions be reversed on him, especially in regards to his opinions on characters.^[642][2]
     * ESAM is the most prominent user of the [643]Bidou control scheme in Smash 4; however, since he does not use Bidou for any character other than Pikachu, this sometimes causes him to have multiple control schemes in tournament, especially when controlling other characters such as [644]Samus.
     * ESAM is a member of a YouTube channel called Games Over Easy, where he plays games alongside fellow smash professional MVD. ^[645][3]
