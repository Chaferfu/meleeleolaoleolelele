Triviaedit

     * ESAM is Nick Riddle's younger brother.
     * ESAM is also a top Divekick player. He won the Divekick event at CEO 2014.
     * ESAM sometimes goes by the alias "Mr. Clean", a reference to his bald head.
     * Due to his attitude and tendency to immerse himself in drama, ESAM is seen as a controversial figure in the Smash community. He is well noted for starting confrontations with other players in social media, and for having questionable or unpopular opinions, particularly his insistence on Pikachu being one of the best characters in SSB4. The latter point has also started a meme in the Smash community as "#ESAMOpinions", being used to refer to any stance that is not widely shared.
          + Ironically enough, he sometimes uses said hashtag to denote how his opinion might not be widely shared in its entirety.
          + He also has a noted tendency to have his opinions be reversed on him, especially in regards to his opinions on characters.^
     * ESAM is the most prominent user of the Bidou control scheme in Smash 4; however, since he does not use Bidou for any character other than Pikachu, this sometimes causes him to have multiple control schemes in tournament, especially when controlling other characters such as Samus.
     * ESAM is a member of a YouTube channel called Games Over Easy, where he plays games alongside fellow smash professional MVD. ^
