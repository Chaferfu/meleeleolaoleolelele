   Eddy Mexico is a Melee Luigi player from Mexico, often considered to be one of the best Luigi mains in the world along with Abate and Ka-Master. He is currently ranked 76th on the 2018 MPGR and was formerly ranked 16th on the SoCal Melee Power Rankings. Despite living in another country, he attends tournaments in southern California so frequently that many smashers in the area consider him a part of their community. He has done well in national tournaments and excellently in locals in his region, taking sets off of players such as Ice, Fly Amanita, Fiction, The Moon, HugS, MacD, JAVI, S2J, SFAT and Westballz in tournament. Eddy Mexico played on HugS's team for the crew battles in GENESIS 3, with the team finishing in 5th place.
