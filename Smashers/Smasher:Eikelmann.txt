   Eikelmann is a Russian-American smasher, originally from Petrozavodsk, Russia, but now residing in Denver, Colorado who mains Ganondorf in Melee but also plays Falco, Bowser and Donkey Kong. He is considered to be one of the best Bowser and Ganondorf mains in the United States with his high level of spacing and character knowledge. He has taken sets off of smashers such as n0ne, S2J, ESAM, s0ft, Wizzrobe, Leffen, and games off of Hungrybox and Mew2King. He remains one of three Ganondorf players (alongside Kage and WhatIsFear) to have taken a game off of Armada's Peach. He was formerly ranked 2nd on the Colorado Power Rankings.

   Following allegations of abuse from former partners as well as misconduct at tournaments, Eikelmann announced via Facebook that he would enter an indefinite hiatus from competitive play.^ He has also been banned in Colorado following the allegations.
