   Envy is a Project M Ike main from New York who is considered to be the best Ike player in the world, known for his very technical play and overall high placements at national tournaments. He is currently ranked 6th on the NY/NJ Project M Power Rankings and 31st on the PMRank 2017. He notably won Project M Showdown 5 over several other well known players such as Gallo and Switch. He initially mained Ike and then Diddy Kong, but after a very disappointing placement at Low Tier City 5, he decided to pick up Wario. However, he switched back to maining Ike in 2018.
