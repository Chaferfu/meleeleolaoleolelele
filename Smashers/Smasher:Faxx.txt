   Faxx is a Melee Yoshi player from Florida who started in late 2014. He is currently the best Yoshi main in Florida and in contention for best active Yoshi in the US. He placed 33rd at CEO Dreamland after double eliminating MattDotZeb, losing to The Moon in pools and Syrox in bracket. Faxx also placed 9th at Frame Perfect Series 2 with wins over Envy, Derdian, and Nagaimo. Unfortunately, Faxx very rarely travels out of region past Florida and Georgia.

   Faxx is currently ranked 2nd on the Tallahasse Power Ranking.
