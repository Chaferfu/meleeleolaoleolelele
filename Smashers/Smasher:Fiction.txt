   Fiction is a smasher from Southern California. He originally started out as a Brawl player maining Wario, where he was the most prolific Wario player in Brawl's early metagame, and overall was considered among the best players at that time. Fiction has since switched to Melee, bringing his knowledge of competitive Smash with him and now maining Fox. As such, he has placed highly at various SoCal local tournaments. His most notable tournament placing has been his 7th place finish at Apex 2014.

   Fiction notably took a set off of Mew2King 2-1 in winners' bracket at SSS Lock-In, including a 3-stock against his Sheik. He also bested him at Do You Fox Wit It?, knocking him out of the tournament with a 2-0 victory. Fiction has also managed to beat Mango in Winners Semis at Mayhem May 2015, in a close 3-2 set.

   In 2015, Fiction primarily switched to maining Marth while keeping Fox as a secondary due to a hand injury. During 2018 Fiction became considerably more active, using primarily Fox along with a new Peach secondary, and managed to restore his skill level to being that of a top 20/30 player, with wins over Wizzrobe, Rishi, AbsentPage, Lucky, and numerous others. He has also become known for his knowledge of the Ice Climbers matchup, with several videos on the character and many wins over ARMY.

   He is currently ranked 11th on the SoCal Melee Power Rankings and 28th on the 2018 MPGR.
