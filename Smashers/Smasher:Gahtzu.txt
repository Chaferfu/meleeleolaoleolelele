Triviaedit

     * At Smash the Record, Gahtzu nearly set the Guinness World Record for "Longest Video Games Marathon Playing a Fighting Game" at 72 hours, which would've beaten the former record of 48 hours. Unfortunately, a video error that occurred during his session delegitimized his entire attempt, despite the amount of witnesses that were present.
     * At Hungrybox's Don't Take My Stock 3, Gahtzu beat Darkrain 5-0 in a Captain Falcon ditto money match.
     * Gahtzu's username is a reference to Guts from the Berserk series, as Guts' name is pronounced "Gattsu" in Japanese.
     * Along with Wizzrobe and Gravy, Gahtzu is a member of 20GX, a movement to reinvent and push the limits of Captain Falcon as a character.
     * Gahtzu won two consecutive $100 money matches against premier Captain Falcon player S2J at CEO 2015.
     * Although Gahtzu is proficient in the Falcon ditto, he lost to Lord at GENESIS 3 including a four stock in game one.
