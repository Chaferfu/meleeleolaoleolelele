   Humpe is a Swedish Melee Falco main. He WAS rank five on the Gothenburg Power Rankings, 6th on the Swedish Power Rankings and 33rd on the European Melee Power Rankings. Humpe enjoys a good game of Smash, _and_ pokken tournament. He made one of the most legendary pokken runs with his Gengar at Dreamhack winter 2016.

   As a streamer, Humpe has a lot of fans. As a matter of fact he's got atleast 20 fans (or followers). Another thing that makes him one of the most beloved players in Sweden is his "raw sex appeal". Further more, some people don't only think he's a skilled player but also one of Europes best whiners.
