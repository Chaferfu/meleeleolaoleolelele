   Additional info
   Real name Cody Schwab
   Birth date January 15, 1995 (age 24)
   Location Queens, New York  United States

   iBDW is a Melee smasher from Queens, New York, previously having attended college in Rochester, New York before graduating. He originally began competing out of curiosity for how far he could progress in late Spring of 2015, but after having difficulty finding practice in person he began grinding on Anther's Ladder, where he quickly rose to the top of the rankings. His play style makes heavy usage of Fox's up-air for juggles, his tilts and mobility for zoning and approaching, and quick out of shield options to create openings or end stocks.

   He has wins over players such as SFAT, Swedish Delight, HugS, Westballz, Shroomed, lloD, KJH, Hax$, Fiction, ARMY, and many others. He is currently ranked 2nd on the NYC Metropolitan Area Melee Power Rankings and 34th on the 2018 MPGR.

Triviaedit

     * When he was younger, his Xbox tag was "iBDoiNWorK" which he then shortened to iBDW upon coming into the competitive smash scene, though some have mistaken it for "i Body Deez Weebs." At this point, it likely stands for nothing.
