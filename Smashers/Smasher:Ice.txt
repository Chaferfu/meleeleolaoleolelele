   Ice is a German [35]smasher located in the Berlin area. He is a major competitor in German tournaments, but has gone international and made strong impacts; his most notable showings were a 7th place finish at [36]EVO 2013 and [37]GENESIS 3 and 3rd at [38]The Big House 6, the latter being his best performance at an international tournament so far. He was considered to be one of the best Melee [39]Sheik mains in the world along with [40]Mew2King, [41]KirbyKaze, and [42]Overtriforce before his switch to [43]Fox. He is known for his prowess in the Fox, Marth, and Sheik matchups, and has taken sets off of top professionals such as [44]Zhu, [45]Hax, Overtriforce, [46]Mango, [47]Westballz, and even [48]Leffen in Fox [49]dittos in tournament. Ice is currently ranked 1st on the [50]German Melee Power Rankings, 4th on the [51]European Melee Power Rankings, and 39th in the world on the [52]2018 MPGR.

   On October 21st 2016, [53]Luminosity Gaming picked up Ice as their first [54]Super Smash Bros. Melee player and second overall Smash player. Ice left the team on October 19, 2017.^[55][1] On March 2nd, 2018, Ice was picked up by Red Bull Esports.^[56][2]^[57][3]

Playing style[[64]edit]

   Informally known as the "European [65]Mew2King", Ice is one of the top Fox mains in the world, and used to be one of the best Sheik and Marth mains in Europe. Between all of his characters, Ice is extremely smooth and consistent in his [66]tech skill, rarely missing inputs or SDing. As Sheik and Marth, Ice is known for creative and lethal punishes, solid movement, consistent edgeguards, and proficient [67]tech chases and [68]chaingrabs. Ice's Sheik in particular was much more aggressive than those of other Sheik mains, as he frequently opted for dash attack and down tilt reads that would lead into highly damaging strings. As Fox, Ice retains his powerful punishes, edgeguarding, and general aggression, but also showcases his extremely high technical proficiency to the fullest extent, especially with [69]shine and aerial pressure on the opponent's shield. He has also one of the best tech reactions in the game, as pointed out by [70]TheCrimsonBlur at [71]The Big House 6 (he called Ice "The
   Best Techer in Smash").

   Ice used to have a lackluster neutral game compared to other top players, and performed poorly against top professional players of lesser-played characters because he did not know how to properly punish them. For example, he was defeated twice by [72]s0ft's [73]Jigglypuff at [74]Apex 2014, showing a lack of knowledge of how to properly punish [75]Rest with Sheik. He also could not take a game from [76]aMSa's [77]Yoshi at [78]Republic of Fighters 3 due to his failure to combat Yoshi's egg camping and [79]DI away from his combos. However, after picking up Fox and addressing various issues in his gameplay, including his matchup problems, these upsets have been minimized, shown by Ice defeating aMSa 2-1 in Grand Finals at a Xanadu event two years later.
