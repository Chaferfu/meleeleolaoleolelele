Playing styleedit

   Jeapie is known for his technical and flashy way of playing and is credited as one of the first European players to heavily incorporate shield platform dropping in his game. He is also known for his prowess against Sheik; although Sheik is traditionally considered a difficult matchup for Captain Falcon, he frequently manages to overcome high-level Sheik players. This was particularly made apparent at Republic of Fighters 3, where he made top 8 in a top 32 bracket that pitted him exclusively against Sheik players. At this point he boasts wins over all notable Sheik mains in Europe, including Android, Amsah, and Overtriforce.

Biographyedit

   Jeapie first started playing Super Smash Bros. Melee upon the game’s PAL release in 2002. In 2006 he started playing competitively, but it wasn’t until 2008 that he entered his first tournament: at X-TC 4 in Almere, he ended up placing 13th. He gradually established himself as one of the better Dutch players, doing well at several locals and placing 13th at his first international tournament, Berlin Calling (April 2010), where a set against fellow Falcon main Pamaro generated a lot of hype ^. He would go on to place 9th at ZEST5 and B.E.A.S.T (Sweden) and 7th at OSTS: Saber, before hitting his stride during 2012’s Haags Kwartiertje tournament series, losing grand finals at HK1 to Zgetto and winning HK2 over Remen. He did however reach a low point at HK5 in May 2012, where he got 7th place after a surprising loss to Enig. After this tournament, he decided to take a break from the game, citing diminished enjoyment.

   Jeapie fortunately got his passion for the game back and attended hf.lan 5 in Paris (June 2013), coming back strong at a 5th place. He went on to never place outside top 8 while attending major events such as B.E.A.S.T 4, Republic of Fighters 3 and Avalon I through IV. In June 2014, he was picked up for a sponsorship by LowLandLions ^.
