   Juggleguy, occasionally referred to as JuggleRob, is a Michigan Smasher and one of the most influential tournament organizers in the United States. He is best known for hosting [18]The Big House tournament events, the largest Smash tournament series in the Midwest. He is the founder of UM Smash, directing its official website and social media outlets in addition to hosting tournaments on campus, including the interuniversity series SWEET (Spartans and Wolverines Exhibit Entertaining Tourneys) which alternates between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University.

   Besides his tournament organizer role, he also serves as a senator and tournament moderator on [19]Smashboards; produces community content such as the annual Melee Year in Review; manages one of the most popular YouTube channels in the Melee community; and perhaps most notably, is a member of the [20]Melee It On Me team, serving as a podcast co-host while also managing week-to-week operations. After a brief stint with [21]Brawl, Juggleguy started playing Melee competitively in 2008, playing Captain Falcon and using his black palette swap inspired by [22]Darkrain. He is currently ranked 4th on the [23]Michigan Melee Power Rankings.

   [24]The Big House was a Midwest Melee super regional event in 2011, producing 115 entrants and finishing in one day. [25]The Big House 2 was a Midwest Melee national event and the fourth-largest Melee tournament overall in 2012, producing 128 entrants and finishing in two days. [26]The Big House 3 was a Midwest Melee national event and the third-largest Melee tournament overall in 2013, producing 172 entrants and finishing in two days. [27]Super SWEET was a Midwest Melee national event that featured Armada's debut in the Midwest, producing 165 entrants and finishing in two days. [28]The Big House 4 was a Midwest Melee national event, representing the third-largest Melee tournament in 2014 and the then-fourth-largest Melee tournament of all-time, producing 574 entrants and finishing in two days. [29]The Big House 5 was a Midwest Melee international event, representing the second-largest Melee tournament in 2015 and, at the time, of all-time, producing 1320 entrants and finishing in three
   days. He has wins over [30]KJH, [31]Duck, [32]Kalamazhu, [33]Dope, [34]Prince Abu, [35]Slayer, [36]Ryan Ford, [37]Sung, and [38]Frootloop.
