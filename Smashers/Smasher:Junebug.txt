   Junebug is a smasher from Centreville, Virginia who was widely considered to be the best [51]Diddy Kong player in Project M from 2014-2016 and is still considered one of the best [52]Diddy Kong players in Project M (along with [53]BaconPancakes and [54]Luck), and is considered to be the best [55]Ganondorf player in [56]Project M. He also used to play [57]Lucario in [58]Brawl and was once considered the best before the rise of [59]Trela, having defeated several top players including [60]DEHF and [61]Mew2King. More recently, Junebug has showed greater interest in [62]Melee and is a strong [63]Sheik player having taken sets off top players such as [64]Colbol, [65]Zain, [66]lloD, [67]Syrox, and has taken a game off [68]Leffen. Junebug is currently ranked 3rd on the MD/VA Melee Power Rankings, 4th on the MD/VA Project M Power Rankings, 34th on the [69]PMRank 2018, and 45th on the [70]2018 MPGR. He was formerly ranked 6th on the MD/VA Brawl Power Rankings, 17th on the MD/VA Smash 4 Power
   Rankings, and 76th on the [71]2014 SSBBRank.

   Junebug is currently considered to be one of the best Project M players and was generally considered to be the best throughout 2015 for his dominant and consistent record. However, after [72]Olympus, Junebug decided to go on a hiatus from Project M in order to focus on Melee. He returned to the game at [73]Smash 'N' Splash 3.
