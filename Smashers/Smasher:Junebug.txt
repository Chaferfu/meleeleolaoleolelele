   Junebug is a smasher from Centreville, Virginia who was widely considered to be the best Diddy Kong player in Project M from 2014-2016 and is still considered one of the best Diddy Kong players in Project M (along with BaconPancakes and Luck), and is considered to be the best Ganondorf player in Project M. He also used to play Lucario in Brawl and was once considered the best before the rise of Trela, having defeated several top players including DEHF and Mew2King. More recently, Junebug has showed greater interest in Melee and is a strong Sheik player having taken sets off top players such as Colbol, Zain, lloD, Syrox, and has taken a game off Leffen. Junebug is currently ranked 3rd on the MD/VA Melee Power Rankings, 4th on the MD/VA Project M Power Rankings, 34th on the PMRank 2018, and 45th on the 2018 MPGR. He was formerly ranked 6th on the MD/VA Brawl Power Rankings, 17th on the MD/VA Smash 4 Power
   Rankings, and 76th on the 2014 SSBBRank.

   Junebug is currently considered to be one of the best Project M players and was generally considered to be the best throughout 2015 for his dominant and consistent record. However, after Olympus, Junebug decided to go on a hiatus from Project M in order to focus on Melee. He returned to the game at Smash 'N' Splash 3.
