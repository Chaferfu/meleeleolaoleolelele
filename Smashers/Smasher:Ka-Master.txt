   Ka-Master, also known as Luigi Ka-Master, is an American smasher from the Washington area who was known in the 2007 era for his success in tournaments using Luigi, and for his knowledge of the space animal matchups. He has released two very well-received combo videos and is currently considered the best Luigi player in the world. He has taken sets off of players such as Lucky, Zhu, HugS and MacD.

   He also has a strong Captain Falcon, having taken sets off Bladewise and Iceman.

   Ka-Master is currently ranked 2nd on the Washington Melee Power Rankings and 58th on the 2018 MPGR.
