   Kage The Warrior (pronounced "kaw-gay") is a [33]Ganondorf player from Canada who is considered to the best in the world with that character. Kage rose to notoriety for his upset at [34]Revival of Melee 2 where he double eliminated [35]Mango, who was considered the best player in the world in the time, with a 2-0 victory in Winners Quarters (with [36]a 3-stock against Mango's Falcon) and a 2-1 victory in Losers Semifinals. However, he lost to [37]Hungrybox in Winners Semis and [38]PPMD in Losers Finals. Kage continues to be a threat in the Melee scene, consistently placing high at tournaments even with a mid-tier character. He is ranked 2nd on the [39]Montreal Power Rankings for Melee and was formerly ranked 3rd for [40]Project M. On the [41]2017 SSBMRank, he was ranked 46th. At [42]EVO 2015, he and [43]Bizzarro Flame finally had their $100 [44]money match at the Salty Suite, with Kage taking a convincing 5-0 victory. After [45]EVO 2016, he announced his intentions to focus more on his
   other characters, and less on Ganondorf, but still continues to primarily play Ganondorf and [46]Captain Falcon. On July 29th 2016, he was picked up by [47]Synthetik Gaming, but left them on June 19th, 2017. On February 18th, 2018, he joined Mirage.
