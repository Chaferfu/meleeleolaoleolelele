   Kage The Warrior (pronounced "kaw-gay") is a Ganondorf player from Canada who is considered to the best in the world with that character. Kage rose to notoriety for his upset at Revival of Melee 2 where he double eliminated Mango, who was considered the best player in the world in the time, with a 2-0 victory in Winners Quarters (with a 3-stock against Mango's Falcon) and a 2-1 victory in Losers Semifinals. However, he lost to Hungrybox in Winners Semis and PPMD in Losers Finals. Kage continues to be a threat in the Melee scene, consistently placing high at tournaments even with a mid-tier character. He is ranked 2nd on the Montreal Power Rankings for Melee and was formerly ranked 3rd for Project M. On the 2017 SSBMRank, he was ranked 46th. At EVO 2015, he and Bizzarro Flame finally had their $100 money match at the Salty Suite, with Kage taking a convincing 5-0 victory. After EVO 2016, he announced his intentions to focus more on his
   other characters, and less on Ganondorf, but still continues to primarily play Ganondorf and Captain Falcon. On July 29th 2016, he was picked up by Synthetik Gaming, but left them on June 19th, 2017. On February 18th, 2018, he joined Mirage.
