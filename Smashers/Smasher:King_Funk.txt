   Real name Julius Vissing
   Birth date December 20, 1991 (age 27)
   Location Copenhagen  Denmark

   Julius Vissing, aka King Funk, is a smasher, tournament organizer and commentator currently residing in Copenhagen, Denmark. Formerly a SSB64 and Brawl player, Julius now exclusively plays Melee, as well as a variety of other fighting game titles (currently Dragon Ball FighterZ & Tekken 7). He is currently ranked #1 on the Danish Power Rankings for SSBM. He is also the main tournament organizer for Valhalla, Denmark's major European Smash tournament series.

   King Funk started out with Brawl in Portugal in 2008, where he co-founded the competitive scene with Flayl and hosted the country's first few tournaments. In 2010, he moved to Denmark for his studies and quickly transitioned from Brawl to Melee as most players in Scandinavia favored the latter as their game of choice. Julius was also for a long time one of Europe's best SSB64 players until he quit the game in late 2012 to focus on other fighting games.

   King Funk frequently commentates at European events such as DreamHack and hosts local and regional tournaments (mostly the "Hive" and the "King Funk's Castle" series). In January 2018, he organized Denmark's first major tournament, Valhalla, attracting 250 attendees from all over Europe.

Triviaedit

     * In Smash 64, King Funk was infamous for his creative and seemingly "random" use of the Falcon Dive, which he would generally use as an effective tool to punish shielding (in particular on platforms) as well as for tech-chasing purposes. While King Funk was in Japan in the summer of 2012, he demonstrated his uses of the Falcon Dive, which Japanese players would later affectionately name after him.
