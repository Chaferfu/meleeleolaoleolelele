   KirbyKaze is a professional Canadian [27]Melee player from Markham, Ontario (born in Thornhill), regarded as the best [28]Sheik player from Canada and one of the best Sheik players in North America, along with [29]Mew2King, [30]Plup, [31]Shroomed, and [32]Swedish Delight. From 2010-2012, he was a top 8 player in the world and recorded the best results of his smash career to date, going head-to-head with USA's best, defeating [33]Mango and [34]PPMD at [35]Revival of Melee 3 and [36]Hungrybox at [37]Apex 2012. KirbyKaze is currently ranked 29th on the [38]2017 SSBMRank and was formerly ranked 1st on the [39]Ontario Melee Power Rankings.

   After taking a small break, KirbyKaze marked his return to Smash in 2014 by placing 4th at [40]Get On My Level 2014. He has since seen strong results, notably [41]SWEET Prologue which he won, and [42]Apex 2015 where he took 7th. He had an unexpectedly low 97th placing at [43]EVO 2015. In December 2015, KirbyKaze announced that he was retiring; however, he has since come out of retirement, attending more tournaments and netting impressive placements such as 9th at [44]The Big House 6 and 4th at [45]Canada Cup 2016.
