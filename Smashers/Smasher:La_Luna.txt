Trivia[[225]edit]

     * La Luna is one of the four [226]Marth players that has been able to take a set off of [227]Fly Amanita's [228]Ice Climbers in tournament, with the others being [229]PewPewU, [230]Ken, and [231]Azen.
     * La Luna has been notably upset by a few mid and low-tier mains, including [232]Phish-It's [233]Donkey Kong at [234]Zenith 2012, [235]Qerb's [236]Mr. Game and Watch in locals, [237]Saus' [238]Link at [239]Get On My Level 2015, [240]Kage's [241]Ganondorf at [242]The Big House 5, and [243]Green Ranger's Donkey Kong at [244]Nebulous Prime.
     * He is also known for being the origin of a commentator meme in the Melee community. Years ago, when he was not as well-known as a player, he claimed that one of Falco's most popular ledge getup options (the ledge hop double [245]laser) was actually an "unsafe" option, contrary to popular opinion. This was brushed off at the time, but frame data and advancements in the metagame have since shown that he was actually correct. As such, when modern Falco mains perform this technique and are punished for it, commentators will often reference La Luna and quote the history of his claim.
     * La Luna almost always plays white Marth, but switches to black Marth when in grand finals of a tournament. When he was called The Moon, he referred to this as "the dark side of the moon".
