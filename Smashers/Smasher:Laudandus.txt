Triviaedit

     * Laudandus is notorious for his hate for the Captain Falcon match up, infamously quoting that Falcon gets "Air Wobbles into Rest" on much of the cast. He has since improved his understanding of the match up, but is still an admin of "Captain Falcon: A Hate Group" on Facebook along with gaR.
     * Laudandus is a Latin word that means "must be praised."
