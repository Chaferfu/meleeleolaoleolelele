   Legend is a Melee Jigglypuff main from Montreal, Quebec. He is considered to be the best Jigglypuff player in Canada. Legend caught the attention of the Smash scene after upsetting KirbyKaze and easily beating Bizzarro Flame at Shine 2017. His win against Bizzarro Flame, while notable, is hardly surprising given Legend's matchup experience against Ganondorf. The Jigglypuff player has played sets on a near weekly basis with Kage, the best Ganondorf player in the world. Legend's other notable wins include La Luna, Nightmare, Ryan Ford, Dizzkidboogie, Mafia, Tian, and Vwins. He is currently ranked 1st on the Montreal Melee Power Rankings and 85th on the 2018 MPGR.
