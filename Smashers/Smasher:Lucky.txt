   Location Norwalk, California  USA

   Lucky is a Fox player from Norwalk, California who usually teams with Mango at nationals. He also uses Marth and Captain Falcon as secondaries, which has garnerned him the nickname of Batman while playing as the latter. Lucky's name is actually Jose, but some people including Mango have used the nickname "Joey" and it has since been used. Lucky is currently ranked 3rd on the SoCal Melee Power Rankings, 18th on the 2018 MPGR, and was formerly ranked 5th on the SoCal Project M Power Rankings.

   Lucky emerged as a notable player in the SoCal community when he started teaming with Mango at tournaments, and the two began to achieve high placings at doubles events, such as 5th at Zero Challenge 3 and 3rd at Super Champ Combo, beating the famed team of Ken and Isai (El Chocolate Diablo) at the latter, with the team being known as "4-Leaf Mango". Lucky also placed quite highly in singles events, placing 17th at both Zero Challenge 3 and EVO World 2007.

   Lucky is currently considered one of the best Fox mains on the West Coast, along with Mango and SFAT. He consistently places highly at nationals, with some of his more notable recent placings including 9th at MLG Anaheim 2014, 4th at Kings of Cali 4, 13th at EVO 2015, 4th at Get On My Level 2016, 9th at GENESIS 4, 5th at EVO 2017, and most recently 5th at GENESIS 5. He has taken sets off of top players such as Hungrybox, Mew2King, Axe, Wizzrobe, SFAT, S2J, Westballz, La Luna, PewPewU, and n0ne in tournament.

   The Big House 4 is almost unarguably Lucky's best and most memorable performance. After losing early in the bracket to Kalamazhu, Lucky went on a tear through loser's. He defeated Darrell and Gahtzu to secure Top 32, and then went on to defeat Zanguzen, DJ Nintendo, Colbol and even knocked Hungrybox into 9th in an upset to secure top 8, where he then defeated Westballz and brought Mango through an incredibly close 5 games where he lost in a last stock, last hit situation, securing 5th place at the tourney.
