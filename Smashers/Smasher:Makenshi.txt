   Makenshi is a Parisian smasher who mains Marth and secondaries Link. He became well-known in the French Smash community in 2004, when he attended RT in Dijon. As a fan of Ken, he tried to improve, taking inspiration from the so-called "King of Smash", but in the end, he managed to develop his own style. He attended quite few European tournaments, and placed quite well, creating a rivalry with Swedish Marth player Ek. He is currently ranked 8th on the French Melee Power Rankings and 34th on the European Melee Power Rankings. He is one of the best Marth mains in Europe.

   When Brawl was released in the US, he declared he would quit Melee, but came back to it after a few months, saying that Brawl was too limited for him.
