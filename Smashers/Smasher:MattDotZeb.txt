Triviaedit

     * MattDotZeb is notorious for his upsets against top players; he sporadically defeats professionals far above his skill level, including Leffen, in tournament. He is equally as notorious for being upset by lower-leveled or unranked players, often quitting mid-match out of those sets. He has a positive record against Leffen, 1-0.
