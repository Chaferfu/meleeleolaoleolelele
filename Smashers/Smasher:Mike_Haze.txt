Background[[51]edit]

   MikeHaze began playing Melee in 2006, after seeing [52]HugS play at a tournament his school held. His first tournament was Champ Combo: Yayuhzzzz Edition.

   Mike competed throughout many west coast events throughout this era, although never reached a ranked player status in his initial days of Melee. As of 2008, MikeHaze began playing Brawl for fun, while playing Melee competitively throughout Southern California. After a 3rd place finish at Nexus 08, MikeHaze retired from Melee.

   MikeHaze then played Super Smash Bros. Brawl competitively, and was ranked 3rd on the Southern California Power Rankings prior to his retirement. He was considered the best Brawl Marth player in the United States throughout its active competitive life, as he beaten top players such as Ally before in tournament, and always significantly outperformed other Marths in the country. On the world stage, while MikeHaze's Marth was still among the best, [53]Mikeneko and [54]Mr. R outperformed MikeHaze's Marth at nationals.

   In 2011, Mike started the "Elite 4 Series," a series of Brawl events that helped keep the SoCal Brawl scene thriving. Over 25 tournaments were held for the series, a few of which also featured Melee.

   During the Summer of 2013, MikeHaze stopped organizing events to focus on his professional competitive career. With no active Brawl tournament series and the release of Project M Mike began competing in Melee once again, still playing his former main, Fox.

Combo video[[208]edit]

   MikeHaze is the creator of the combo video [209]Rise and SHINE.

Trivia[[210]edit]

     * He lends his name to the "MikeHaze rule," a tournament rule that prohibits players from yelling and making abrupt and loud noise to disrupt their opponents, after he yelled loudly numerous times during [211]a money match vs. [212]Hylian.
