   Monib is a Canadian Luigi main. His breakout performance was at Summit 2016 where he upset Trulliam 2-0 in winners round 1. At that same tournament he managed to secure himself top 8, his first at a tournament of that size. Monib continues to place very well at many Ontario majors/regionals, and has started travelling out of country to become a stronger player. He is mostly known in the Esports world for his Dota 2 prowess. Being ranked one of the highest players in the world, and playing with Team Vegetable Esports Club (first iteration), he quickly gained fame for his insane Invoker play.
