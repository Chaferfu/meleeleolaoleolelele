   MrLz (also known as 4est) is a smasher from Florida who is considered to be the best Project M Mr. Game & Watch main in the world. He is known for performing extremely well despite his young age. He won the second largest Project M tournament of all time, Paragon Los Angeles 2015 at only 13 years of age.

   In April of 2017, he suffered from an aortic dissection, and received successful emergency surgery. Hungrybox created a GoFundMe page to cover the fees of the surgery, reaching the goal of $3,500 in less than a day.
