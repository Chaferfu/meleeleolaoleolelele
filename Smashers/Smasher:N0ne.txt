Tournament historyedit

   His breakthrough performances were at The Big House 4, The Come Up and McSmashter 4, each with successively better placings. At McSmashter 4, he made a fierce run into losers bracket, defeating Idea, RaynEX, and Kage before losing to Vwins (the only player he lost to in the Melee tournament) and ending up in 3rd place behind him and Armada. He also placed top 8 in Project M that same tournament.

   n0ne remained a tournament threat throughout the rest of 2015 and coming into 2016, placing very high at Canadian majors such as Summit 2015 and Smash INTENSIFIES 2, defeating Fox mains Colbol, DJ Nintendo, and Professor Pro to achieve 3rd place at Tipped Off 11, and most notably defeating PewPewU at GENESIS 3 with a 2-0 victory.

   In March 2016 n0ne attended and won a very stacked pre-Pound 2016 Smash @ Xanadu, going undefeated the whole tournament, defeating Amsah, Nintendude and double eliminating The Moon.

   n0ne also attended and won both singles and doubles (with Ryan Ford) at SWEET XXIV. He defeated KJH and then Prince Abu twice in singles, beating him in winners finals and the second set of grand finals 3-0 (Prince Abu won the first grand finals set with an extremely close 3-2), ending the last set with a 0-to-death combo.

   He also had an excellent showing at Fight Pitt VI, defeating both Eddy Mexico and SilentSwag 3-0 to place 4th in singles, and earning 2nd place in doubles with Eddy Mexico.

   At Get On My Level 2016, he had a very close set with Ice, but ended up losing 2-1 before making it into Top 32. After his loss, he defeated Vanitas 2-0 and Trulliam 3-1, and upset PewPewU 3-2, HugS 3-2, and Mew2King 3-1. It is interesting to note that Mew2King had not lost to Captain Falcon at a major in over a decade, the last time being to Isai at MLG Anaheim 2006. It also marks the first time a player ranked below 50 on the SSBMRank upsets one of the Gods. He then played against Lucky in a very intense losers eighths set, ultimately losing in a last stock, last hit scenario and finishing 7th.

   He attended Smash 'N' Splash 2 defeating Duck in winners and was sent to losers by Hungrybox, where he defeated KJH afterwards and lost to Shroomed to achieve his first top 8 place finish at a national in the United States.

   n0ne attended SoCal Colosseum 2 in SoCal. He defeated Chillin, S2J, MikeHaze, and S2J in Grand Finals to win the tournament.

   He attended Smash Factor 5 in Mexico, defeating JAVI in winners semifinals, but lost to HugS in winners finals. He defeated JAVI once again in losers finals and HugS in Grand Finals 3-2 and 3-1 respectively to win the tournament.

   He won Kickstart 10 in the UK, where he defeated Vanity Angel, Overtriforce, and Professor Pro.

   At Smash Summit 3, he lost 0-3 to both Armada and Axe, placing 13th.

   In November 2016, n0ne travelled to North Carolina to attend Super FamiCon 2016. He faced off with Colbol in winners semis and ended up losing to him 2-3. In an impressive losers run, he defeated $mike, Colbol in the rematch to make it to grand finals, where he defeated Druggedfox 6-0, to win the tournament. He also placed 1st in Project M Singles, and won Melee doubles alongside Druggedfox

   He attended UGC Smash Open, which was the last tournament that would impact the MIOM rankings for 2016. He placed 5th after a very impressive winners run, defeating PewPewU, MikeHaze and Mew2King for the second time in 2016. This makes him the only Captain Falcon player to have 2 set wins over a god in 2016.

   In January 2017, in SoCal he took his second Colosseum at Smash Colosseum #7, where he defeated The Moon, Westballz, S2J and Druggedfox to win the whole tournament without dropping a set.

   He attended DreamHack Austin 2017 and placed 9th, where in Winners Top 48 he managed to defeat Mew2King for the third time in his career with Captain Falcon.

   He attended DreamHack Montreal 2017, where he won the event without dropping a single game in Top 8.
