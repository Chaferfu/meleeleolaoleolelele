Tournament history[[53]edit]

   His breakthrough performances were at [54]The Big House 4, [55]The Come Up and [56]McSmashter 4, each with successively better placings. At McSmashter 4, he made a fierce run into losers bracket, defeating [57]Idea, [58]RaynEX, and Kage before losing to [59]Vwins (the only player he lost to in the Melee tournament) and ending up in 3rd place behind him and [60]Armada. He also placed top 8 in [61]Project M that same tournament.

   n0ne remained a tournament threat throughout the rest of 2015 and coming into 2016, placing very high at Canadian majors such as [62]Summit 2015 and [63]Smash INTENSIFIES 2, defeating Fox mains [64]Colbol, [65]DJ Nintendo, and [66]Professor Pro to achieve 3rd place at [67]Tipped Off 11, and most notably defeating [68]PewPewU at [69]GENESIS 3 with a 2-0 victory.

   In March 2016 n0ne attended and won a very stacked pre-[70]Pound 2016 [71]Smash @ Xanadu, going undefeated the whole tournament, defeating [72]Amsah, [73]Nintendude and double eliminating [74]The Moon.

   n0ne also attended and won both singles and doubles (with [75]Ryan Ford) at [76]SWEET XXIV. He defeated [77]KJH and then [78]Prince Abu twice in singles, beating him in winners finals and the second set of grand finals 3-0 (Prince Abu won the first grand finals set with an extremely close 3-2), ending the last set with a [79]0-to-death combo.

   He also had an excellent showing at [80]Fight Pitt VI, defeating both [81]Eddy Mexico and [82]SilentSwag 3-0 to place 4th in singles, and earning 2nd place in doubles with Eddy Mexico.

   At [83]Get On My Level 2016, he had a very close set with [84]Ice, but ended up losing 2-1 before making it into Top 32. After his loss, he defeated [85]Vanitas 2-0 and [86]Trulliam 3-1, and upset [87]PewPewU 3-2, [88]HugS 3-2, and [89]Mew2King 3-1. It is interesting to note that [90]Mew2King had not lost to Captain Falcon at a major in over a decade, the last time being to [91]Isai at [92]MLG Anaheim 2006. It also marks the first time a player ranked below 50 on the [93]SSBMRank upsets one of the [94]Gods. He then played against [95]Lucky in a very intense losers eighths set, ultimately losing in a last stock, last hit scenario and finishing 7th.

   He attended [96]Smash 'N' Splash 2 defeating [97]Duck in winners and was sent to losers by [98]Hungrybox, where he defeated [99]KJH afterwards and lost to [100]Shroomed to achieve his first top 8 place finish at a national in the United States.

   n0ne attended [101]SoCal Colosseum 2 in SoCal. He defeated [102]Chillin, [103]S2J, [104]MikeHaze, and [105]S2J in Grand Finals to win the tournament.

   He attended [106]Smash Factor 5 in Mexico, defeating [107]JAVI in winners semifinals, but lost to [108]HugS in winners finals. He defeated [109]JAVI once again in losers finals and [110]HugS in Grand Finals 3-2 and 3-1 respectively to win the tournament.

   He won [111]Kickstart 10 in the UK, where he defeated [112]Vanity Angel, [113]Overtriforce, and [114]Professor Pro.

   At [115]Smash Summit 3, he lost 0-3 to both [116]Armada and [117]Axe, placing 13th.

   In November 2016, n0ne travelled to North Carolina to attend [118]Super FamiCon 2016. He faced off with [119]Colbol in winners semis and ended up losing to him 2-3. In an impressive losers run, he defeated [120]$mike, [121]Colbol in the rematch to make it to grand finals, where he defeated [122]Druggedfox 6-0, to win the tournament. He also placed 1st in [123]Project M Singles, and won Melee doubles alongside [124]Druggedfox

   He attended [125]UGC Smash Open, which was the last tournament that would impact the [126]MIOM rankings for 2016. He placed 5th after a very impressive winners run, defeating [127]PewPewU, [128]MikeHaze and [129]Mew2King for the second time in 2016. This makes him the only Captain Falcon player to have 2 set wins over a [130]god in 2016.

   In January 2017, in SoCal he took his second Colosseum at Smash Colosseum #7, where he defeated [131]The Moon, [132]Westballz, [133]S2J and [134]Druggedfox to win the whole tournament without dropping a set.

   He attended [135]DreamHack Austin 2017 and placed 9th, where in Winners Top 48 he managed to defeat [136]Mew2King for the third time in his career with Captain Falcon.

   He attended [137]DreamHack Montreal 2017, where he won the event without dropping a single game in Top 8.
