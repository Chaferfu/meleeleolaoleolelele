Pedophilia and sexual assault allegations[[28]edit]

   The editor who added this tag elaborates: massive rewrite

   On July 16th, 2018, Harassment Task Force member Josh Kassel, who goes by the tag [30]Roboticphish, released a statement saying that Nightmare (then unnamed) had been accused of grooming a minor and sexual assault. On the same day, Nightmare tweeted out a statement made from his lawyer, which stated that he was not charged nor associated with grooming of a minor and sexual assault, and also threatening those who wants to ban him from tournaments with legal action^[31][1]. Right off the bat, people pointed out the suspicious wording of the statement, suggesting that it was written for cover-up. Nevertheless, Nightmare was still allowed to compete in tournaments.

   However, at [32]DreamHack Montreal 2018, even though Nightmare was competing, he was competing under the pseudonym N; furthermore, none of his matches were streamed. This revived suspicion on Nightmare's allegations. A few days later, on September 24, 2018, [33]Trulliam, on stream, confirmed that Nightmare has been charged with sexual interference; around the same time, Nightmare protected his Twitter. The following day, Even Matchup Gaming indefinitely banned Nightmare from further competition, as per the new Code of Conduct recently published by the Harassment Task Force.^[34][2] ^[35][3].
