   Nintendude is a [60]smasher from Ithaca, New York who currently resides in San Francisco, California. He is currently ranked 6th on the [61]NorCal Melee Power Rankings, 56th on the [62]2017 64 League Rankings, and 65th on the [63]2018 MPGR. He was formerly ranked 1st and 15th on the [64]MD/VA/DE Melee and Project M Power Rankings, respectively, and was 25th on the unfinished [65]Smash 64 ELO Rating.

   He is currently considered to be one of the best [66]Melee [67]Ice Climbers players in the world, having defeated top players such as [68]Mango, [69]Mew2King, [70]Plup, [71]Axe, [72]Westballz, [73]PewPewU, [74]Hax, [75]KirbyKaze, and [76]Zhu. He is mostly known for his high use of [77]wobbling, along with many creative setups to maximize its use. He is also a notable [78]Fox player and a former [79]Mario main in [80]Smash 64, and has taken sets off high-level players such as [81]Fireblaster, [82]Revan and [83]Stranded in tournament. For this reason, he is considered to be the best Mario player in North America, and even the world. He does play [84]Mr. Game & Watch in [85]Project M, but has not achieved the results of other top Game & Watch players such as [86]MrLz and [87]Dakpo.

   Nintendude is also one of the most prominent tournament organizers on the east coast. In addition to being a staff member of Apex from 2010 until 2015, he administered the Smash @ Clarendon tournament series in Arlington, VA, in addition to other large local tournaments such as PrEVO 2015, he was a head organizer for Super Smash Con and PAX Prime 2015, and helped organize [88]Pound 2016. He is a moderator on the [89]/r/smashbros subreddit, where his username is "Elbedhar". Nintendude was picked up by Splyce (then known as FolloweSports.com) along with [90]MacD on August 24th, 2015.^[91][1] On March 3rd, 2018, Splyce announced their departure from Melee, losing Nintendude and MacD in the process.^[92][2]

Trivia[[300]edit]

     * Nintendude has won the [301]Smash @ Xanadu weekly [302]Melee tournament 31 times, which is more times than any other smasher.
     * Due to his very high use of wobbling compared to other Ice Climbers players, as well as his many setups into the technique, Nintendude is infamous in the community, more so than other Ice Climbers players. However, he has revealed in his Reddit AMA [303]he actually thinks of it as a terrible gameplay mechanic, and the reason why he uses it much more compared to other Ice Climbers players is because he had practiced for several years to execute sophisticated grab combos with them (similar to those of [304]Wobbles), though they became obsoleted by his use of the mechanic, and he knows the characters can do great things without wobbling. He also said he would still main the Ice Climbers even if the mechanic didn't exist.
          + Despite this, it is interesting to note that in [305]Project M the [306]Ice Climbers cannot wobble, and he mains Mr. Game & Watch in said mod. Although he has countered this by stating in his AMA that he mains Mr. Game & Watch out of enjoyment and due to how the crowd was pleased with his performance of said character.
     * At [307]Shine 2016, he became the first Ice Climbers main to defeat [308]Mango since Wobbles at [309]EVO 2013.
     * Nintendude notably placed 13th in Smash 64 doubles partnered with a level 9 Luigi CPU at [310]GENESIS 5. His original partner, [311]Isai, had been suffering from hand pain was unable to play.^[312][3]
          + Had Isai been able to play with Nintendude, this would have marked the first time since [313]Apex 2012 the two have played together in doubles.^[314][4]
