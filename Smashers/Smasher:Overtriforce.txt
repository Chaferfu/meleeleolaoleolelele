   Overtriforce became well-known internationally at Epita Smash Arena 2, where he won doubles with Strawhat Dahean, defeating Captain Jack and Masashi in winners' semis, Calle W and Svampen in winners' finals, and Captain Jack and Masashi again in grand finals. He also placed 13th in singles, losing to Makenshi in winners' bracket and to Zgetto in losers' bracket.

   He attended Epita Smash Arena 3 the following year and placed 9th in singles, taking out Baxon before losing to Armada in winners' bracket and then to Zgetto once again in losers' bracket. He also teamed with Strawhat Dahean again in doubles and placed 2nd, defeating Amsah and Adam in winners' semis and losers' finals, but losing to Armada and Aniolas in winners' finals and grand finals. Four months later, at Super Lion 4, Overtriforce made it to grand finals, but eventually lost to Amsah, placing 2nd.

   In early 2010, Overtriforce attended his first tournament in the United States, Pound 4, where he placed 17th. At said tournament, he 3-stocked Mew2King's Marth in a game in winners' bracket, although he still lost the set 1-2. He then lost to PPMD in losers' bracket.

   In 2012, Overtriforce placed 4th at Epita Smash Arena 5, losing to Armada 0-3 in winners' semis, then defeating Leffen 3-2 in losers' quarters before losing to Ice 2-3 in losers' semis. He later attended two Apex 2013 qualifiers - Smashers' Reunion: Melee Grande, where he placed 7th, losing to Armada in winners' quarters and to Zgetto in losers' top 8, and King Funk's Castle II: Måske, where he placed 2nd, defeating Leffen 4-1 in losers' finals before losing to Armada 0-4 in grand finals.

   Overtriforce made an appearance in the United States at Apex 2013 in early 2013, where he climbed through the 128 man bracket, defeating KevinM 2-0, Cyrain 2-1, Scar 2-1, and Axe 2-0 before losing to Hungrybox in winners' quarters. He then lost to Shroomed 0-2 in losers', ending his run at 9th place.He also participated in the USA vs The World Crew Battle, where he managed to take out Hungrybox, but not without losing 3 of his stocks to him. Three months later, he placed 3rd at B.E.A.S.T 3, defeating Scar 3-1 in winners' quarters and Jeapie 3-2 in winners' semis before losing to Mango 2-4 in winners' finals and then to Ice 3-4 in losers' finals.

   Overtriforce's next national was B.E.A.S.T 4, where he placed 4th, defeating Jeapie 3-2 in winners' quarters before losing to Armada 0-3 in winners' semis, and then defeating Tekk 3-2 in losers' quarters before losing to Leffen 1-3 in losers' semis. He then attended Republic of Fighters 3, where he lost to Jeapie in the first round of winners' bracket, but made a long run through losers' bracket, taking out Vegard, Cyr, Tekk 2-0, Salepate 2-1, and Jeapie 3-1 in a rematch in losers' top 8, before losing to aMSa 1-3 in losers' quarters, finishing off at 5th place.
