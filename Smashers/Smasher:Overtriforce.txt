He also teamed with Strawhat Dahean again in doubles and placed 2nd, defeating [51]Amsah and [52]Adam in winners' semis and losers' finals, but losing to Armada and [53]Aniolas in winners' finals and grand finals. Four months later, at [54]Super Lion 4, Overtriforce made it to grand finals, but eventually lost to Amsah, placing 2nd.

   In early 2010, Overtriforce attended his first tournament in the United States, [55]Pound 4, where he placed 17th. At said tournament, he 3-stocked [56]Mew2King's Marth in a game in winners' bracket, although he still lost the set 1-2. He then lost to [57]PPMD in losers' bracket.

   In 2012, Overtriforce placed 4th at [58]Epita Smash Arena 5, losing to Armada 0-3 in winners' semis, then defeating [59]Leffen 3-2 in losers' quarters before losing to Ice 2-3 in losers' semis.

   Overtriforce made an appearance in the United States at [62]Apex 2013 in early 2013, where he climbed through the 128 man bracket, defeating [63]KevinM 2-0, [64]Cyrain 2-1, [65]Scar 2-1, and [66]Axe 2-0 before losing to [67]Hungrybox in winners' quarters. He then lost to [68]Shroomed 0-2 in losers', ending his run at 9th place.He also participated in the [69]USA vs The World Crew Battle, where he managed to take out Hungrybox, but not without losing 3 of his stocks to him. Three months later, he placed 3rd at [70]B.E.A.S.T 3, defeating Scar 3-1 in winners' quarters and [71]Jeapie 3-2 in winners' semis before losing to [72]Mango 2-4 in winners' finals and then to Ice 3-4 in losers' finals.

   Overtriforce's next national was [73]B.E.A.S.T 4, where he placed 4th, defeating Jeapie 3-2 in winners' quarters before losing to Armada 0-3 in winners' semis, and then defeating [74]Tekk 3-2 in losers' quarters before losing to Leffen 1-3 in losers' semis. He then attended [75]Republic of Fighters 3, where he lost to Jeapie in the first round of winners' bracket, but made a long run through losers' bracket, taking out [76]Vegard, [77]Cyr, Tekk 2-0, [78]Salepate 2-1, and Jeapie 3-1 in a rematch in losers' top 8, before losing to [79]aMSa 1-3 in losers' quarters, finishing off at 5th place.
