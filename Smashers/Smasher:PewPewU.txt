Triviaedit

     * PewPewU is the first Marth player who has been able to take a set off of Fly Amanita's Ice Climbers and one of the four to do so, the others being Ken, The Moon, and Azen.
     * In doubles, PewPewU uses the tag "FAT" while his teammate SFAT uses the tag "PEW". These tags are in reference to the opposite teammates name, as well as the team name, which is PewFat.
