   Plank, also known as Plairnkk, is a smasher who mains Sheik in Melee and Project M. He also played Meta Knight in Brawl, where he popularized the technique planking, so named after him. He was formerly ranked 14th on the MD/VA Melee Power Rankings and 15th on the MD/VA Project M Power Rankings. He was also ranked as a hidden boss on the 2015 SSBMRank.

   Before 2011 Plank was one of MD/VA's most respected TO's, as he was the main TO for the Pound tournament series (Pound 4 was the largest Melee tournament for three and a half years before being surpassed by EVO 2013). After Pound V he drew significant controversy after he announced that he would be unable to pay out the winners of the tournament due to financial issues he came across when hosting it. Nearly ten thousand dollars of prize money was lost, and the incident heavily stained the reputation of Plank, leading to Plank having been the only TO to have ever been placed on Smashboard's tournament organizer blacklist, as well as a hiatus of the Pound tournament series for nearly three years. However, Plank stated that he would be hosting Pound 2016, the sixth main event in the Pound tournament series after nearly three years, along with having paid the money from the event to most, if not all of the winners. Plank was removed from the blacklist after completely
   paying out the Pound V players in 2015.

   Plank is a very solid Melee player in his own right; with his Sheik, he has taken sets off of players such as Chillin, Nintendude, I.B, The Moon, Mango, Abate, Kage, and more.
