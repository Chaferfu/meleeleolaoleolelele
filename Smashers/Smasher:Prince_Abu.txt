     * There exists a significant statistical correlation between Hungrybox's losses vs. Armada and Prince Abu's presence at a tournament, (due to Prince Abu being available as a practice partner) which has been termed by some as "The Prince Abu Effect". Armada has commented on this, calling Prince Abu "[his hero" for helping him to prepare for the Jigglypuff matchup.
     * Contrary to popular belief, Prince Abu has tech skill comparable to that of other top players, most notably with Fox and Falco.
