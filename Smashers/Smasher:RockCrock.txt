   RockCrock is a Ganondorf main from Ft. Myers, Florida. He is extremely knowledgeable about Melee, and of many players. He began his career in 2003 playing Fox, then moved to Ganondorf. He was considered to be arguably one of the best Ganondorf players in the United States, and recognized as one of the South's better players. He used to attend college at the University of Florida and went on to get a Master's degree at Florida Gulf Coast University. RockCrock was formerly ranked 8th on the Florida Melee Power Rankings in May 2014. As of right now, RockCrock is presumed to be on a hiatus due to his career as an occupational therapist.

Historyedit

   RockCrock began playing Melee competitively in 2003 and quickly rose to become the best Fox player in Florida. He often trained with his brother Andrew (UberIce), Phanna, and the brothers DaShizWiz, KeepSpeedN, and SmashMac. Early after changing his main to Ganondorf, he often teamed with friend and fellow smasher QueenDVS, playing under the team name "ThunderSkullTip". He hosted many tournaments in his home town of Ft. Myers, FL, and earned the Tournament Director title on SmashBoards. He began attending the University of Florida in Gainesville, FL in Fall 2007, and played with the likes of Exarch, Derf, SubScorpion, and Harriettheguy. When Brawl came out, he tried to play as his favorite video game character, Sonic, but became very disheartened with the way that Brawl turned out, and now rarely plays it anymore. He then played Melee with a crew consisting of himself, Harriettheguy, BladeOfApollo, Raistlin, and other smashers in Gainesville.
   Because his usual team partner, QueenDVS went to the University of Central Florida in Orlando, FL, RockCrock often enters doubles with Harriettheguy as his teammate. He has also began to play Project M and mains Sonic in the game; However, he is dissatisfied of the recent lack of PM in Florida and the competitive scene in general because of the recent issues that have surrounded the mod & Nintendo.

Tournament attendanceedit

   RockCrock has attended many large tournaments, placing well at most, including the MLG series, Pound 3, Revival of Melee 1, GENESIS, Pound 4, and more recently POE3. He is recognized by the South as one of the regions' better players, and has never been absent from a regional crew battle at a national level tournament. He also travels to more local tournaments around Florida and Georgia, including the WATO and Gigabits Series in Orlando, Florida, and the Tipped Off series in Georgia. Nowadays, RockCrock doesn't travel too much to tournaments and plays in his local town in Fort Myers, Florida.
