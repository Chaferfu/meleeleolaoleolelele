Biographyedit

Controversiesedit

   Ford was banned from Melee tournaments in Canada for one year starting in November 2013, primarily due to his sometimes violent conduct at tournaments and his domestic abuse aimed at Kirbykaze "Ryan and I were in a intimate relationship. During this relationship, Ryan struck me six times on five separate instances" . He has also been banned from the Apex tournament series starting with Apex 2013, following an incident where he placed American smasher Inui in a choke-hold in response to his constant heckling at NEC 13, which reportedly involved a racial slur. Additionally, Ford caused further controversy with American smasher Mew2King in the semi-finals for Revival of Melee 5, in relation to splitting and accused bracket manipulation.

Return to Meleeedit

   After a long period of not attending tournaments and a discussion between Toronto's top players and TOs regarding his resolved anger issues, it was decided on March 14th, 2015 that the ban on Ryan Ford should finally be lifted and he was once again allowed to attend Ontario events. Despite being out of commission in tournaments for nearly a year and a half, he continued honing his Melee prowess throughout that entire period, and showed his progress by winning the first weekly he attended since his ban (with n0ne in attendance) and placing very high at SWEET XX and Smash @ York #7, keeping up with Ontario's other top players. During his down time, he also picked up new pocket characters, such as Mario, and since then has been going to various venues for friendlies, in addition to hosting his own friendlies, which are usually streamed on his Twitch account.
