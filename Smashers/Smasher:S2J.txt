Playing styleedit

   Even for a player of his caliber, S2J has an excellent neutral game, using a combination of precise wave-dashing and dash-dancing to perfectly space his attacks. He is also one of the best defensive Falcons with good smash DI and mix-ups with Falcon's otherwise poor recovery. His punish game is notorious among smashers for being able to 0-death with just one combo (usually beginning with a grab), which is known as a Johnny Stock. He is also a read-heavy player.

   A major weakness of S2J's game is his poor edgeguarding. While it has been recently getting better, he is still known to make poor decisions and sometimes even self-destructing by just attempting to edgeguard like at Apex 2015 against PPMD and at The Big House 5 against Abate. He also admitted that his mental game could get better if not for having a mindblock against Westballz, Lucky, and SFAT, 3 players who he frequently plays against and loses to for the most part. He said that this is the main reason that he hasn't reached the top 10 spots on the SSBMRank, particularly the 6th-10th spots, which include Mango, Wizzrobe, aMSa, Zain, and Axe. Due to his read-heavy playstyle, he also relies on the player's habits, meaning he does better against other players he has played before.

Triviaedit

     * According to his ask.fm, S2J quit his job to play Melee near-full time, but also plays online poker for income.
     * Despite being one of the best Captain Falcon players, he hates Falcon dittos.
     * He used to reside at Mango's house and streamed there as well, providing in-depth analysis of professional Captain Falcon matches, including his own.
     * He used to enter some locals with the tag "Captain Blowjob".
     * He was the first Captain Falcon main to reach top 8 at EVO, doing so at EVO 2016.
     * In his interview with Tempo Storm, S2J said he attended UCLA, and that's where he became seriously interested in Melee.
     * S2J notably almost 3-0d Armada at GENESIS 4, taking him down to last stock, last hit in game 3. However, he ended up losing the set 2-3 following a reverse 3-0 by Armada.
