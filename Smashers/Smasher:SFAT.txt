Triviaedit

     * Leffen challenged SFAT to a $1,000 first-to-five money match,^ to which he accepted. This took place at DreamHack Winter 2015, where SFAT lost 1-5. This ties SFAT with smashers Mang0 and Tian for the biggest loss from a money match.
     * SFAT is the leading actor of You're Watching SFAT, a series of short videos featuring the smasher in bizarre and comical situations that debuted on December 29th, 2015. Sometimes others smashers like PewPewU and Shroomed make an appearance as well.
     * In doubles, SFAT uses the tag "PEW" while his teammate PewPewU uses the tag "FAT". These tags are in reference to the opposite teammates' names, as well as the team name, which is PewFat.
