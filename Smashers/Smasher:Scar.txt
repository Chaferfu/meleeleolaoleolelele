History

   Scar is introduced in the Smash Bros. Invitational rules video.

   Bobby Scar started playing Melee in early 2007, meeting Cactuar, Pakman, and other Philadelphia players somewhat randomly. With Cactuar becoming his primary training partner, Scar enjoyed many of the perks of being a pro vicariously, and his intense dedication to the game resulted in his quick rise from obscurity.

   Perhaps another reason for Bobby Scar's prominence is his extensive use of branding. He has self-promoted since the release of his first combo video, I Killed Mufasa. The video's success propelled him to what was then said to be "an undeserved level of recognition", and "catching up to his reputation" became one of Scar's most important goals.

   Since then, Bobby Scar became known as one of the best Captain Falcon professionals in America during his prime. He is also a co-founder of the crew "The Mini-Bosses." Scar further cemented his position as one of the best Falcon players after placing 6th at GENESIS, higher than any other Falcon player there. He moved to northern California and defeated another top-ranked Falcon, SilentSpectre, in a money match at his first northern California tourney, R3.

   Since 2013, Bobby Scar has been working at Twitch, primarily serving as the first ambassador of the Smash community. D1, TheCrimsonBlur, and Toph would eventually join Twitch with the collaborative purpose of growing the Smash community.

   Bobby Scar, Prog, and D1 were selected by Nintendo to commentate the Super Smash Bros. Invitational tournament. Their participation was revealed in the form of Smash 4 newcomer-style images. Months later, he appeared, along with Toph, as a commentator in Nintendo's Smash 4 event at San Diego Comic Con, and later commentated together during the Top 8 bracket at EVO 2015.

   Bobby Scar currently co-hosts the recently revived "Scar and Toph Show" with Toph (airing live on Melee It On Me's Twitch stream every other Monday evening), often discussing any topic they desire with some relevance to the Smash scene as a whole before ending the show off with a first-to-3 Melee set to determine whose name gets to be first on the show's title (as votes for either order were even, and it originally started off with "Toph and Scar" due to Toph instigating the show's revival and commissioning the logo's artwork). He would finally defeat Toph in episode 3 of the "Scar and Toph Show", and earned the right to have his name first on the show's title for the next episode. Scar also appears on "Terrible Tuesdays" with fellow Twitch staff member BenSW, where he watches BenSW do blind playthroughs of various games without assisting him. Scar, along with Toph, also hosts The Reads since April of 2017. Produced by Cross Counter TV, this show has Toph and Scar invite a different
   guest every month, releasing 4 consecutive 20-25 minute episodes weekly.

   He continues to enter local tournaments simply as MIOM|Scar (omitting the fact that Twitch is technically also a crew name), though he is semi-inactive when it comes to attending majors; he is often at events for commentary instead. He has beaten players such as Cactuar, SwiftBass, ZoSo, Hax, DJ Nintendo, Vwins, PC Chris, Isai, SFAT, S2J, MacD, Tafokints, Taj, Wife, and Jman.

Trivia

     * Bobby Scar's face can be used as a global emote on Twitch that anyone can use (named PeoplesChamp).
     * Bobby Scar commonly insists that he placed 5th at GENESIS, rather than 6th, forgoing the fact that he and Mew2King played out an additional set that would determine the actual 5th placed player, and subsqeuently lost.
          + He further elaborates that he did not want to play this tiebreaker set, since GENESIS was a double elimination tournament like every other Melee singles event in majors, and believes that the players that are 5th place and below do not need to fight for their tied position.
               o GENESIS 3 was supposed to feature a tiebreaker set for 5th place; however, PPMD opted out of the set, and placed 6th in the tournament below SFAT. Notably, there was no such set for 7th place, as Nintendude and Ice both remained at 7th.
     * Besides Smash, Bobby Scar is also proficient in Ultra Street Fighter IV, citing former Twitch co-worker, Mike Ross, as his mentor for improving in said game. Due to this student/teacher relationship, he has appeared in a few episodes of "Capcom Pro Talk", mostly discussing his Smash origins, noting the parallels between the Super Smash Bros. and Street Fighter series, and helping Mike Ross defend Twitch turbos.
          + Mike Ross also guest starred in episode 2 of the "Scar and Toph Show", where they discussed the origin of "The Excellent Adventures of Gootecks and Mike Ross" and the feud involving Bobby Scar, Mike Ross, and TheCrimsonBlur that nearly ended their friendship because of a long argument about whether Scar was a relevant smasher or not. Scar was eventually dubbed relevant because he recalled his resume from his tournament days and an outside fan recognized Scar from his EVO Melee commentary; he and the fan took a picture shortly afterwards.
               o Scar would later be featured on Excellent Adventures Episodes 84-87, and is often mentioned in various other episodes, including ones preceding his debut in the show.
