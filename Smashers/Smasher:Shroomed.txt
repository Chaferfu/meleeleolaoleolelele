   Shroomed is a top professional Melee player who mains Sheik and Marth, and is widely considered to be the best Dr. Mario player in the world. Despite Dr. Mario's status as a mid-tier character, Shroomed was able to perform exceptionally well with him, shown by his victories over renowned smashers such as Leffen, KirbyKaze, and Overtriforce. He consistently finished in the top 8 of big name tournaments such as Apex 2013 and EVO 2013 with only Dr. Mario; however, after an uncharacteristically low placement at Apex 2014, Shroomed decided to switch his main to his former secondary Sheik.

   Shroomed is currently ranked 1st on the NorCal Melee Power Rankings and 29th on the 2018 MPGR.

   He joined the Winterfox team on July 16th, 2015^ and left on December 7th, 2016^. He then joined the Immortals team on December 22nd of the same year.^ He and Immortals eventually parted ways on October 8th, 2018.^

Triviaedit

     * Shroomed tends to be the subject of several memes in the Smash community;
          + At Smash Summit 2, Shroomed revealed that his "real name" is DaJuan Energy McDaniel, and he and SFAT made a short on the reveal.
          + I'm Not Yelling! was named after a brief speech from Shroomed at a Get Smashed at the Foundry weekly where he yelled this phrase whenever someone told him to stop yelling.
          + Shroomed is noted to have a very bright smile, which occasionally elicits sponsors from oral care companies beside his tag.
     * Shroomed is the first smasher to take a set off of Mew2King in a Melee Sheik mirror match.
