   SilentSpectre is an SSBM Captain Falcon player from Northern California, famed for his extremely flashy style of play, extensive combo game titular of his character, and creative and unorthodox usages of Falcon's Knee Smash and moonwalk. In his prime, SilentSpectre was considered to be the best Captain Falcon on the West Coast, and one of the best in the country. He is currently ranked 19th on the NorCal Melee Power Rankings, and was formerly ranked 5th on the NorCal Smash 4 Power Rankings.

   At Pound 4, SilentSpectre teamed with fellow Falcon player, Darkrain, and placed 2nd, an unexpectedly high placing given the team composition. In Singles, he upset Armada, and placed 9th.
