   Silent Wolf is an American smasher located in the Washington area. He has defeated top players such as Mew2King, Leffen, and PPMD. He was ranked 20th on the 2016 SSBMRank.

   At EVO 2014, Silent Wolf placed 7th in Melee singles. Although he lost to Darkrain 0-2 early in winners' bracket in the winners' quarters pool, he made a very long run through the losers' bracket, defeating players such as Cactuar and Duck to make it into the top 32, and then defeating SFAT 2-1, Shroomed, Fiction 2-0, and Leffen 2-1. In losers' top 8, he was eliminated by Axe 1-2, in addition to being four stocked in one of the matches that took only less than a minute.

   At HTC Throwdown, Silent Wolf easily cruised into top 8 in winners side, beating Ralph, Shroomed and DruggedFox along the way. In top 8 he lost to Leffen 0-3 right away. In losers he beat Mew2King and DruggedFox again. In losers finals he won game 1 against Hungrybox, but ended up losing to him 1-3.

   He is also one of the best Donkey Kong Country speedrunners.

   On January 15th, 2018, Silent Wolf announced his retirement from competitive play, citing a lack of interest.^
