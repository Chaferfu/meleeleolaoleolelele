   SmashBob SquarePants is a Jigglypuff main from South Carolina.

   In 2016, SmashBob earned his first notable achievement by beating Redd at South Carolina's largest regional event, Tiger Smash IV.

   Afterwords, he demonstrated constant improvement and became one of the highest ranked players in the State. From there he began traveling out of state, where he would go on to defeat several power ranked players from both Georgia and North Carolina, cementing himself as a top threat in the SouthEast.

   Recently, SmashBob made the national spotlight by earning a spot in Top 8 of MomoCon 2017 where he defeated notable smashers KPAN and The Moon finally ending in a 5th place finish.

   Currently, he is ranked 2nd on the Melee and 6th on the Project M South Carolina Power Rankings
