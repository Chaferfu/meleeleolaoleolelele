Tournament history[[55]edit]

   Swedish Delight placed 13th at the second largest [56]Melee tournament at the time, [57]The Big House 5, beating [58]Westballz in top 64 winners before losing to [59]SFAT. He then won vs [60]Zhu before losing to [61]Duck. Along with his partner, [62]Nintendude, this was also the highest placing of any Atlantic North smasher at this event outside of [63]Abate.

   Swedish Delight and doubles partner [64]Slox emerged as a formidable duo in 2016. At [65]GENESIS 3, they took two sets, 2-0 and 3-2, off of [66]Hungrybox and [67]Axe, placing 3rd. They followed this with 4th and 5th place finishes at [68]Pound 2016 and [69]CEO 2016 respectively.

   One of his most impressive performances was at Pound 2016, where he made Top 32 in winners' side. His first set in the bracket was against [70]Laudandus, where he defeated him 2-0. Next came his set against [71]Professor Pro, where the latter lost 3-2. Entering winners' semis, he was pitted against Hungrybox, where he was defeated 3-0, knocking him into losers' bracket. After being knocked out, he was pitted against Laudandus again, this time defeating him 3-0. In losers' semis, [72]Mango clutched it out in a nailbiter set 3-2, ending his run at 4th place.

   [73]Smash 'N' Splash 2 was one of his best performances at a national, defeating [74]S2J and Westballz, as well as winning two sets against [75]Mew2King, only losing twice to Hungrybox to earn a strong 2nd place finish. He interestingly opted to use [76]Luigi against Hungrybox in grand finals.

   At CEO 2016, he displayed consistency by placing 9th, with wins over Nintendude and [77]DJ Nintendo, and followed this with a strong 9th place finish at the largest tournament of all time, [78]EVO 2016.

   At [79]Shine 2016, he again impressed with a 5th place finish, with wins over Nintendude, Westballz, and [80]HugS. He was sent to losers by Mew2King and eliminated by Mango.

   He placed 9th at [81]The Big House 6, falling to [82]Armada 0-3 in winners, then eliminating [83]Leffen 3-0 and [84]Shroomed 3-0 before being eliminated by Hungrybox 2-3 in losers.

   At [85]EVO 2018, Swedish Delight notably became the first player outside of Mango, Hungrybox, Mew2King, [86]PPMD, Leffen, and [87]Plup to beat Armada in more than eight years.
