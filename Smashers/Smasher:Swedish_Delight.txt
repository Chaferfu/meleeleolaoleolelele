From late 2015 to 2016, he emerged as a strong contender, placing high at numerous majors and taking wins over many top players. By late 2016, he was placing consistently in the top 12 at major tournaments including CEO 2016, EVO 2016, Shine 2016, and The Big House 6. At EVO 2018, he became the first non-top-tier player to beat Armada in more than eight years.

Tournament historyedit

   Swedish Delight placed 13th at the second largest Melee tournament at the time, The Big House 5, beating Westballz in top 64 winners before losing to SFAT. He then won vs Zhu before losing to Duck. Along with his partner, Nintendude, this was also the highest placing of any Atlantic North smasher at this event outside of Abate.

   Swedish Delight and doubles partner Slox emerged as a formidable duo in 2016. At GENESIS 3, they took two sets, 2-0 and 3-2, off of Hungrybox and Axe, placing 3rd. They followed this with 4th and 5th place finishes at Pound 2016 and CEO 2016 respectively.

   One of his most impressive performances was at Pound 2016, where he made Top 32 in winners' side. His first set in the bracket was against Laudandus, where he defeated him 2-0. Next came his set against Professor Pro, where the latter lost 3-2. Entering winners' semis, he was pitted against Hungrybox, where he was defeated 3-0, knocking him into losers' bracket. After being knocked out, he was pitted against Laudandus again, this time defeating him 3-0. In losers' semis, Mango clutched it out in a nailbiter set 3-2, ending his run at 4th place.

   Smash 'N' Splash 2 was one of his best performances at a national, defeating S2J and Westballz, as well as winning two sets against Mew2King, only losing twice to Hungrybox to earn a strong 2nd place finish. He interestingly opted to use Luigi against Hungrybox in grand finals.

   At CEO 2016, he displayed consistency by placing 9th, with wins over Nintendude and DJ Nintendo, and followed this with a strong 9th place finish at the largest tournament of all time, EVO 2016.

   At Shine 2016, he again impressed with a 5th place finish, with wins over Nintendude, Westballz, and HugS. He was sent to losers by Mew2King and eliminated by Mango.

   He placed 9th at The Big House 6, falling to Armada 0-3 in winners, then eliminating Leffen 3-0 and Shroomed 3-0 before being eliminated by Hungrybox 2-3 in losers.

   At EVO 2018, Swedish Delight notably became the first player outside of Mango, Hungrybox, Mew2King, PPMD, Leffen, and Plup to beat Armada in more than eight years.
