   Twitch is a professional smasher from North Carolina who mains Fox. Twitch had for a while been a high-ranking player on the North Carolina Melee Power Rankings, last ranking 2nd on the Summer 2016 list, and is also PPMD's younger brother. His most notable tournament placing was 3rd at Bad Moon Rising, a regional in North Carolina, where he defeated Colbol, who was then ranked third in the Florida Power Rankings, twice, as well as defeating DruggedFox. Twitch finished behind Hungrybox and Plup, but ahead of players such as Nintendude and Wizzrobe. In the same tournament he teamed with $mike and finished fifth. Other victories by Twitch prior to Bad Moon Rising include Arc, ESAM, baka4moe, and Mike Haze.
