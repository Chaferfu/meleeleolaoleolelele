   Weon-X is one of Canada's top Melee Fox mains (with Marth and Falco as secondaries), as well as one of the top Project M players in Ontario. He is originally from Chile and was ranked in Chile's Melee Power Rankings before moving to Canada. He has shown that he can contend with some of the best Melee players by placing top 8 at events such as Revival of Melee 7, Super SWEET, The Come Up, and McSmashter 4. In Project M, he has regularly met Ally in grand finals at Canadian events, going relatively even with him in sets. He was ranked 43rd in the Melee It On Me 2014 SSBMRank, and was formerly ranked 4th and 1st in the Southern Ontario Power Rankings for Melee and Project M respectively before taking a break from attending regionals and majors in the last quarter of 2015, which consequently dropped him out of the 2015 SSBMRank.

   Weon-X made a return in April 2016 at Lan ETS 2016, scoring an impressive 2nd place in singles over Kage and Coffeeblack, just behind Ryan Ford, and winning doubles with Kage.
