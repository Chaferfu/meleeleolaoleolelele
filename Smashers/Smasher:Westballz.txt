Biography[[58]edit]

Origin of the name[[59]edit]

   Westballz created his gamertag while watching his brother play Halo, and based it off his brother's gamertag "Nickelnutz", replacing "Nickel" with "West" and "nutz" with "ballz".

Playing style[[60]edit]

   Westballz is often seen as the most technical Falco player in the world in both Melee and Project M. He is infamous for his very high-risk/high-reward punishes, often going for extremely technically demanding combos that can rack up extremely high amounts of damage and put his opponents into dangerous positions. As such, his punish game as Falco, particularly his [61]platform follow-up ability, is arguably the best in the world. A very technical player whose playstyle heavily incorporates [62]shield dropping, Westballz generally tends to show off his tech skill as much as possible such as multishining in place [63]even in a neutral position. He is also known for his flashy secondaries, most notably his [64]Captain Falcon, which he used to [65]land a Sacred Combo on [66]ZeldaFreak at [67]Kings of Cali 3.

   Westballz has stated that his success against top-caliber players stems from his ability to condition opponents and mix-up his approaches. He will often utilize a certain set of approaches in friendlies to condition players while learning their playstyle, then when he plays those same opponents in tournament, he will completely switch his playstyle, keeping his opponents adapting while controlling the match.

   However, Westballz has a worse [68]neutral game compared to his punish game. A common misconception is that Westballz is a very aggressive player, no matter who he is playing. However, against stronger players, he takes a much slower approach to the neutral game, spacing up tilts and back aerials to try to catch his opponent to then exploit his superior punish game, rather than directly applying pressure. This approach, combined with him not utilizing Falco's [69]Blaster as well as other Falcos such as [70]Mango and [71]PPMD, often leads to his opponent controlling the pace of the match if he cannot get an opening.

   Additionally, while Westballz has more wins against top players like Mango and [72]Leffen under his belt than most others of his caliber, he is rather inconsistent, and is infamous for losing games, or even sets, to players far below his skill level. At [73]Rubicon 2, he gained a 3-stock lead on [74]KJH, but attempted to "style" on him with unsafe attacks for the rest of the game, [75]allowing KJH to mount a 4-stock comeback. He [76]also lost to [77]Jake13, a mid-level Falco, at [78]Low Tier City 2, after [79]sandbagging and losing with [80]Donkey Kong in game 1. He also occasionally becomes overwhelmed by pressure, making untimely [81]self-destructs that lead to his defeat, such as in Loser's Semis at [82]Pat's House 2 against [83]Fly Amanita's lone [84]Ice Climber in a last stock, last hit situation. Intending to input a back aerial, he accidentally inputted an unsafe down aerial that spiked Popo onto the stage while he self-destructed, ending his run.
