Tournament history[[68]edit]

Multigame Beginnings[[69]edit]

   Wizzrobe's first major was [70]Apex 2013. While his placings in [71]SSB and [72]SSBM were mediocre, placing 33rd and 97th respectively, in [73]PM, he placed 2nd, defeating [74]Hungrybox and [75]Leffen, before falling to [76]TheReflexWonder. He would carry over this strong performance to [77]Zenith 2013, which he won, dropping only one game to Hungrybox. He is often credited for the subsequent nerfing of [78]Sonic in the later versions of PM.

   The next year, he attended [79]Apex 2014, having substantially improved outside of PM. In SSB, he placed 5th, defeating [80]Kefit and [81]Firo before being defeated by [82]SuPeRbOoMfAn. He then advanced to Top 8 by defeating [83]Star King. After beating [84]JaimeHR, he lost to [85]Mariguas. In SSBM he placed 49th.

   At [86]CEO 2014, Wizzrobe placed 2nd in PM, defeating [87]ESAM and Mew2King, before being double eliminated by [88]ZeRo. He won PM Doubles with [89]Plup, double eliminating Mew2King and ZeRo. In [90]SSBM he placed 5th, notably defeating [91]Colbol. Attending [92]Zenith 2014, in SSBM he repeated his CEO 2014 performance, placing 5th, upsetting [93]Axe before losing to [94]Hax and [95]Zhu. In [96]SSB, he placed 3rd, defeating [97]The Z before losing to SuPeRbOoMfAn and [98]KeroKeroppi. In PM, he placed a disappointing 9th, falling early to [99]Junebug and then to [100]Frozen.

   One month later at [101]Tipped Off 10, Wizzrobe won PM Singles, defeating Mew2King and [102]Master Raven, and also won PM Doubles with Plup, defeating Mew2King and Hungrybox and ESAM and [103]MVD. He also placed 4th in SSBM singles, where after losing to Axe, he made a Losers' run, defeating [104]Twitch, [105]Gahtzu, and Plup before losing to Colbol.

   In July of 2016, at [106]WTFox 2, in SSBM, Wizzrobe placed 4th, solidly defeating Hungrybox in a surprise upset. Wizzrobe went on to fall to [107]Mango. He then defeated [108]The Moon before falling to Mew2King in a close set. He placed 1st in SSB at the event.

   The next month, Wizzrobe attended [109]Super Smash Con 2016, where he took 2nd in SSB, defeating [110]Isai, [111]Prince, and [112]Kurabba along the way, being double eliminated by SuPeRbOoMfAn. He placed 9th in SSBM at the event, defeating [113]Ice before losing to Mango and Axe.

   In January 2017, at [114]Smash Conference LXIX, Wizzrobe scored 3-0 victories over both Hungrybox and [115]SFAT placing 2nd to Mew2king in a 2-set Grand Finals(2-3, 1-3). Also in January, he placed 5th at [116]GENESIS 4 in SSB, defeating SuPeRbOoMfAn for the first time.

   In April 2017, he again scored 2nd, this time at the U.S. invitational [117]Smash Rivalries with victories over [118]ChuDat, [119]DruggedFox and his first ever win over Mew2King (3-0). Wizzrobe, coming from Loser's Bracket, won the first set of Grand Finals over Hungrybox, but lost the second set.

   In August 2017, he dropped from Melee at [120]Super Smash Con 2017 to focus on 64, which he placed 5th in, losing to Zero in Winners Round 2 and then making a losers run until meeting SuPeRbOoMfAn in Losers Quarters. At this event, he also participated in the Smash Masters event, defeating ZeRo in finals to take 1st place.

   Later that month, he took 1st at [121]Shine 2017 in 64, double eliminating [122]Alvin in Grand Finals after losing to him in Winners Finals, winning his first Smash 64 major.

   In Smash 4, Wizzrobe has taken sets off of [123]Ally, [124]Abadango, [125]Fatality, [126]Mr E, [127]dyr, and [128]Reflex. He was well known for being one of the best Sheik mains in the United States throughout 2015 and early 2016.

Trivia[[335]edit]

     * Wizzrobe is notorious for his frequent long stalls. It usually takes minutes for him to prepare himself before starting the match.
     * Wizzrobe was trained by fellow [336]SSB [337]Yoshi player [338]SheerMadness.
     * He is known for his excellent tech-chase game and credits it from practicing with level 9 CPUs.
     * His name is derived from the [339]Wizzrobe enemy from [340]The Legend of Zelda series, which he also speedruns, specifically [341]The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.
     * Wizzrobe has stated after losing to Hungrybox at Yahoo's Smash Rivalries tournament, that he will continue to exist as a human further into infinity. What this means is unclear.
