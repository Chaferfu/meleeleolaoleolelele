Tournament historyedit

Multigame Beginningsedit

   Wizzrobe's first major was Apex 2013. While his placings in SSB and SSBM were mediocre, placing 33rd and 97th respectively, in PM, he placed 2nd, defeating Hungrybox and Leffen, before falling to TheReflexWonder. He would carry over this strong performance to Zenith 2013, which he won, dropping only one game to Hungrybox. He is often credited for the subsequent nerfing of Sonic in the later versions of PM.

   The next year, he attended Apex 2014, having substantially improved outside of PM. In SSB, he placed 5th, defeating Kefit and Firo before being defeated by SuPeRbOoMfAn. He then advanced to Top 8 by defeating Star King. After beating JaimeHR, he lost to Mariguas. In SSBM he placed 49th.

   At CEO 2014, Wizzrobe placed 2nd in PM, defeating ESAM and Mew2King, before being double eliminated by ZeRo. He won PM Doubles with Plup, double eliminating Mew2King and ZeRo. In SSBM he placed 5th, notably defeating Colbol. Attending Zenith 2014, in SSBM he repeated his CEO 2014 performance, placing 5th, upsetting Axe before losing to Hax and Zhu. In SSB, he placed 3rd, defeating The Z before losing to SuPeRbOoMfAn and KeroKeroppi. In PM, he placed a disappointing 9th, falling early to Junebug and then to Frozen.

   One month later at Tipped Off 10, Wizzrobe won PM Singles, defeating Mew2King and Master Raven, and also won PM Doubles with Plup, defeating Mew2King and Hungrybox and ESAM and MVD. He also placed 4th in SSBM singles, where after losing to Axe, he made a Losers' run, defeating Twitch, Gahtzu, and Plup before losing to Colbol.

   In July of 2016, at WTFox 2, in SSBM, Wizzrobe placed 4th, solidly defeating Hungrybox in a surprise upset. Wizzrobe went on to fall to Mango. He then defeated The Moon before falling to Mew2King in a close set. He placed 1st in SSB at the event.

   The next month, Wizzrobe attended Super Smash Con 2016, where he took 2nd in SSB, defeating Isai, Prince, and Kurabba along the way, being double eliminated by SuPeRbOoMfAn. He placed 9th in SSBM at the event, defeating Ice before losing to Mango and Axe.

   In January 2017, at Smash Conference LXIX, Wizzrobe scored 3-0 victories over both Hungrybox and SFAT placing 2nd to Mew2king in a 2-set Grand Finals(2-3, 1-3). Also in January, he placed 5th at GENESIS 4 in SSB, defeating SuPeRbOoMfAn for the first time.

   In April 2017, he again scored 2nd, this time at the U.S. invitational Smash Rivalries with victories over ChuDat, DruggedFox and his first ever win over Mew2King (3-0). Wizzrobe, coming from Loser's Bracket, won the first set of Grand Finals over Hungrybox, but lost the second set.

   In August 2017, he dropped from Melee at Super Smash Con 2017 to focus on 64, which he placed 5th in, losing to Zero in Winners Round 2 and then making a losers run until meeting SuPeRbOoMfAn in Losers Quarters. At this event, he also participated in the Smash Masters event, defeating ZeRo in finals to take 1st place.

   Later that month, he took 1st at Shine 2017 in 64, double eliminating Alvin in Grand Finals after losing to him in Winners Finals, winning his first Smash 64 major.

   In Smash 4, Wizzrobe has taken sets off of Ally, Abadango, Fatality, Mr E, dyr, and Reflex. He was well known for being one of the best Sheik mains in the United States throughout 2015 and early 2016.

Triviaedit

     * Wizzrobe is notorious for his frequent long stalls. It usually takes minutes for him to prepare himself before starting the match.
     * Wizzrobe was trained by fellow SSB Yoshi player SheerMadness.
     * He is known for his excellent tech-chase game and credits it from practicing with level 9 CPUs.
     * His name is derived from the Wizzrobe enemy from The Legend of Zelda series, which he also speedruns, specifically The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.
     * Wizzrobe has stated after losing to Hungrybox at Yahoo's Smash Rivalries tournament, that he will continue to exist as a human further into infinity. What this means is unclear.
