   XIF is a Peach main originally from SFL (Miami--Weston area). His name is an acronym for X-Infested Falcon, as it was originally intended, but very few people actually think of it that way anymore.

   XIF gained notoriety in 2007, his claim to fame was the invention and popularization of the Peach pillar technique. Although many players have given this technique different names (lawnmower, condom buster, etc.), XIF still likes to refer to it himself as just "Float Canceled Neutral Airs to *insert another move here*" or "FC Nairs" for short. He first gained notoriety for it at Pound 2, where among other things, broke CunningKitsune's shield. Like some others who have gained notoriety, it is debatable whether he was noticed for playing technically or playing efficiently. He has wins against ChuDat and N0ne.

   Generally accepted by OOSers and OORregioners as the best Peach in the SE, he has become very well known and is a force to be reckoned with. The Peach pillar is quite difficult to get around for those who have never seen it before, and even with consistent practice against it, the variations available can still make it quite tricky.

   XIF used to play with Green Mario, Linguini, Lambchops and other notable SEFL players. He was ranked number 4 on the FL power rankings for the time he was there.

   However, he has recently gone off to college at GA tech and is listed as the 2nd best player in GA (as of September 28, 2007. He recently won a statewide tournament over the top ranked in GA (Chaddd) and is looking to claim the top spot the next time around.

   Previously he is ranked 10th on the Georgia Power Rankings.
