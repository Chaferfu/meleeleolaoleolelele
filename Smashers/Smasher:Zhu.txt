Trivia[[155]edit]

     * Several tournament streams, and even the [156]2014 SSBMRank, jokingly list "Poor" as a sponsor of Zhu as a reference to the Wombo Combo.
     * Zhu is also known to have held a 2-year winning streak over [157]Hax, not losing to him in bracket even once until No Johns 7/2/11, and defeating him in every encounter afterward until [158]Revival of Melee 7.
     * Zhu used the tag CG for some of his sets at EVO 2016, which is a reference to an [159]edited version of the DK Rap by [160]SiIvaGunner.
