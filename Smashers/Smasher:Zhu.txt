   Zhu is a Melee Falco player from Northern California who is considered to be one of the best Falco players in the world. He was initially known most for self-destructing at crucial moments, dubbed "zhuiciding," and being the recipient of the original Wombo Combo. Zhu has made a series of combo videos named "Happy Feet," which showcase his Falco. At GENESIS, he defeated renowned smasher Mew2King in losers' quarters for his placement. At EVO 2016, Zhu has a remarkable performance, defeating players such as Lucky, ChuDat, Laudandus, and Darkrain to get 9th place.

   He is currently helping to run SmashPractice along with Cactuar.

   Zhu is currently ranked 66th on the 2017 SSBMRank. He was formerly ranked 1st on the Philadelphia Melee Power Rankings and 5th on the NorCal Melee Power Rankings.

   On August 4th, 2018, Zhu announced that EVO 2018 would be his last tournament as a competitor.^

Triviaedit

     * Several tournament streams, and even the 2014 SSBMRank, jokingly list "Poor" as a sponsor of Zhu as a reference to the Wombo Combo.
     * Zhu is also known to have held a 2-year winning streak over Hax, not losing to him in bracket even once until No Johns 7/2/11, and defeating him in every encounter afterward until Revival of Melee 7.
     * Zhu used the tag CG for some of his sets at EVO 2016, which is a reference to an edited version of the DK Rap by SiIvaGunner.
