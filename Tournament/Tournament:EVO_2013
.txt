   Evolution 2013, or simply EVO 2013, was the 12th edition of the [25]Evolution Championship Series, a fighting game tournament held annually in Las Vegas, Nevada, which took place on July 12th to 14th, 2013, at the [26]Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. It was the largest Smash tournament of 2013 and currently stands as [27]one of the largest to date, with 709 entrants for [28]Super Smash Bros. Melee.

   Originally, Melee was not to be a featured game at EVO. However, when looking for an 8th game to add to the roster, the EVO staff held a donation drive for breast cancer research, wherein the game community that donated the most money to the drive would have their game featured as an official game at EVO. Although there was stiff competition from the [29]Skullgirls community, a massive push from the [30]Melee It On Me podcast staff resulted in the Smash community raising [31]nearly $95,000 by the final day of the donation drive.

   The tournament is now known as a landmark event and a major turning point in [32]Melee history. It marked the beginning of an explosive rise in the game's popularity, and ushered in an era that featured significantly increased turnout and more new tournaments hosted than ever before. EVO marked the beginning of the [33]Platinum Age, in which Melee transitioned from a largely grassroots scene to a more professional "eSport."

   A particular event that sparked outrage among the entire gaming community was when [34]Nintendo attempted to block streaming for Melee at EVO a few days before the tournament was set to begin. However, because of extreme community backlash, Nintendo retracted the ban hours later. It was [35]later revealed that Nintendo had also attempted to shut down the Melee portion of the tournament altogether.

   However, the tournament proceeded, and Melee joined such games as [36]Super Street Fighter IV and [37]Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on the main stage. For commentary on the main stage, [38]Prog was joined by famed [39]Street Fighter commentator James Chen.

Trivia[[398]edit]

     * Melee was one of two games that broke the EVO record for the most watched fighting game of all time, with roughly 134,000 viewers on the official live-stream.
          + Melee was the first of the two games to break the record, and is currently the second-most watched fighting game of all time.
     * [399]Taylor Hicks, winner of [400]the fifth season of [401]American Idol, tied for 257th place for the Melee tournament.
     * During the winners' finals set between [402]Wobbles and [403]Hungrybox, neither player knew that it was a Best of 3 set. EVO founder Tom Cannon informed the two before a fourth match could ensue.
     * Three matches that were played in Losers' were not accurately reflected in the bracket; in Quarter-Finals Pool I57, the bracket shows that [404]Darkrain defeated [405]Fiction and proceeded to lose to [406]Shroomed, while [407]Axe defeated [408]Lord. In actuality, Fiction defeated Darkrain and proceeded to lose to Axe, while Lord lost to Shroomed. Due to how the brackets work, this seems to have been the players accidentally playing the wrong matches rather than any actual fault of the bracket (with the exception of the incorrect result between Fiction and Darkrain).
