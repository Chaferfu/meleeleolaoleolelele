Mango (often stylized as Mang0, also known as Scorpion Master, The Kid, The GOAT, and The Buster) is a professional Melee player from Norwalk, California who is currently ranked 5th on the 2018 MPGR. He was formerly ranked at the 0 position on the Northeastern Ohio Melee Power Rankings and 1st on the SoCal Melee Power Rankings. Mango is famous for being able to play several characters at a competitive level, making significant impacts at tournaments with Falco, Fox, Marth, Jigglypuff, Mario, Captain Falcon, and Link. Because of his innovations and dominance with Jigglypuff from 2007 to 2009, Mango is generally credited for Jigglypuff's large jump in the Melee tier list, from ranking 6th and 7th with Captain Falcon to ranking 3rd (now 5th). Mango was widely considered to be the #1 best Fox player in the world, though this was before the emergence of the Swedish smashers Armada and Leffen. Thus, he is widely considered to be the best NTSC Fox of all time and the best Falco player in the world (formerly alongside PPMD). Melee It On Me's 2013 SSBMRank and 2014 SSBMRank ranked Mango as the #1 Melee player in the world, and he is one of two smashers in history to have won Melee singles at EVO more than once, performing the feat in the 2013 and 2014 installments of the series. Mango is widely considered to be one of the greatest Melee players of all time.
