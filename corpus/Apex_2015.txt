   Apex 2015 was the sixth edition of the [45]Apex [46]tournament series, a fighting game tournament held annually in New Jersey, which took place on January 30th-February 1st, 2015, at the Garden State Convention Center. Like previous tournaments of the series, Apex 2015 hosted a variety of fighting games, including singles and doubles events for [47]Super Smash Bros., [48]Melee, [49]Brawl, and [50]Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. It currently stands as [51]one of the largest Smash Bros. tournaments to date, with 1,037 entrants for Melee and 837 for Smash 4, previously holding the record for both until [52]EVO 2015.

   Apex 2015 was officially sponsored by [53]Nintendo of America^[54][1]. Among the results of this sponsorship were a lounge where attendees could play a demo version of [55]Splatoon;^[56][2] additionally, Nintendo and [57]ScrewAttack provided a second livestream for the last day of the tournament designed to be clearer for newcomers to competitive Smash.^[58][3] An apparent side effect of the partnership was the absence of [59]Project M from the tournament's lineup of games after its debut at [60]Apex 2014.

Summary[[104]edit]

   The tournament was originally slated to take place at the Clarion Hotel Empire Meadowlands in Secaucus, New Jersey. As the tournament was set to begin, a fire alarm was set off. While the alarm was false, the responding police and fire marshals realized that the venue was unsafe and lacked permits, and subsequently shut down and evacuated the event. After several hours, an alternative venue was found. As players and equipment had to be transported to the new venue, the tournament lost all of Friday and events began on Saturday.

   [105]PPMD, despite being relatively inactive in the Melee tournament scene over the previous months, was able to defeat [106]Leffen in winners' finals and [107]Armada in grand finals to take the Melee tournament for the second year in a row. After Leffen defeated [108]Chillin 5-0 in a match during [109]VGBootCamp's [110]Salty Suite (with the loser being prohibited from using Fox's default color costume in tournament matches), [111]Mango challenged Leffen to a $1,000 match if they faced each other in bracket; the two eventually fought in winners' semis, which Leffen won 3-1. [112]aMSa managed to place 5th in the tournament using [113]Yoshi, defeating [114]Fly Amanita, [115]Zhu, [116]Lucky, [117]SFAT, and [118]KirbyKaze, before being eliminated by [119]Mango in losers' quarters in a 2-3 set. [120]Hax was notably disqualified from Melee singles after not showing at the venue due to a combination of hand pain and insomnia.

2014-2015 Apex World Circuit[[121]edit]

   The 2014-2015 Apex World Circuit was a series of fourteen qualifiers for the Melee singles tournament at Apex 2015. Each qualifier featured a $1,000 prize bonus and complimentary flight and hotel for each of the winners, provided by sponsorship from [122]Twitch.
