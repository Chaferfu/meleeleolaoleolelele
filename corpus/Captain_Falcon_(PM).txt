   Captain Falcon is a playable character in the [15]Brawl mod [16]Project M. He was remade to be nearly identical to his Melee counterpart in terms of attack hitboxes and animations.

   Captain Falcon is currently ranked 9th out of 41 on the [17]official tier list, placing him in the top portion of the A- tier. A slight improvement of his 8th out of 26 in Melee, and a drastic improvement over his 34th out of 38 in Brawl.

   Falcon's Retro Costume in Project M 3.5

   Captain Falcon had the reputation of being one of the worst Brawl characters in spite of his speed and power, as Brawl's physics crippled him and resulted in a massive drop in his tier position. Because of this, he has been reverted back to his Melee incarnation, while retaining a few buffs from his Brawl iteration. Since Project M returns to the physics of Melee, Captain Falcon's combo abilities are once again efficient, as the removal of [38]hitstun canceling no longer allows opponents to air dodge like they could in Brawl. Additionally, the [39]Knee Smash, his main finisher in Melee, is once again as easy to sweetspot as it was in Melee. Captain Falcon also benefits from the normalization of [40]sidesteps; it was lackluster in Melee, but since all sidesteps were made to be roughly the same in terms of frame data in Project M, he is no longer as susceptible to pressure. However, Captain Falcon can still be considered a glass cannon because his high falling speed hinders his already poor
   recovery and makes him susceptible to combos and gimps.

   Captain Falcon fares slightly better in Project M than he did in Melee partially due to the small buffs he's received, but also partially due to the addition of many more semi-floaty characters that Falcon can easily overwhelm and combo, leading him to have good matchups against a majority of the new characters. The expanded stage list, which allows for stage bans even in best of 5 sets, also allows Captain Falcon players to avoid being hard counterpicked to his worst stage in Melee, [41]Fountain of Dreams. In addition, metagame shifts have been favorable to him. Arguably his worst matchup in Melee, [42]Falco, has been slightly nerfed and has worse matchups against the new characters, causing him to be used less often. Other characters from Melee that were difficult to handle have also been nerfed, bringing Falcon's matchups against them closer to even. Due to these factors, Falcon is acknowledged to be better relative to the cast than he was in previous games.

Changes from Melee, Brawl to PM[[43]edit]

   Captain Falcon was mostly reverted to his Melee version while keeping a minority of improvements from Brawl.

Aesthetics[[44]edit]

     * Change Up and down taunts have switched positions. When using down taunt, he now also utters a soft "Yes!" This is an otherwise unused voice clip from Brawl's sound test.
     * Change Kneeling victory pose is now more similar to Melee's version; he will thrust his chest forward and shout while briefly emitting fire.

Attributes[[45]edit]

     * Buff Captain Falcon is the character most affected by Project M's dashing changes; he no longer has a more exaggerated delay before his initial dash animation than every other character (particularly when starting the dash in the opposite direction that he is facing), allowing for much easier dashing jumps than in Melee.
     * Buff Captain Falcon [46]jumps slightly higher (3.1 → 3.23).
     * Buff Captain Falcon's soft landing is 1 frame faster (4 frames → 3).

Ground Attacks[[47]edit]

     * Buff [48]Gentleman (the third hit of [49]neutral attack) is now always separated from the rapid punches, just like in the PAL version of Melee. While there is still a big window of time where pressing the attack button results in the punches, it can be avoided by [50]jab canceling. On whiff, the jab combo has to be slightly delayed to avoid using the jabs.
     * Change The first input of neutral attack has more base knockback (0 → 1).

Aerial Attacks[[51]edit]

     * Change Connecting with a sweetspotted [52]Knee Smash (forward aerial) when a [53]taunt input is held results in Falcon exclaiming "Yes!", like with Falcon Dive.
     * Change Down aerial's [54]nipple spike now uses the fire element, making it more noticeable.

Special Moves[[55]edit]

     * Buff [56]Falcon Punch retains its reversible ability and startup from Brawl. It can now be reversed up to 4 times, receiving a 1% damage bonus per reverse after the first one.
          + Change Each reversal after the first one resets the move's start-up.
     * Buff Aerial [57]Raptor Boost propels Captain Falcon with forward momentum if it lands, and retains its ability to [58]edge sweetspot from Brawl. When used towards an edge from the ground, Captain Falcon now goes into the ending animation instead of instantly becoming helpless, allowing him to still grab the edge and come back to the stage. Landing lag for a successfully connected aerial Raptor Boost has been lowered to match that of a missed aerial Raptor Boost.
     * Buff [59]Falcon Dive retains its vertical distance, its ability to grab foes on the ledge, and its damage (deals 17%, 2% more than Melee's 15%) from Brawl. The move also has slightly higher knockback and its edge sweetspot is now located higher on Falcon's body.
     * Buff [60]Falcon Kick is reversible, and has less endlag. Its lingering hitboxes also have much more favorable angles, making the move safer.

Revisions[[61]edit]

v2.1[[62]edit]

     * Buff Captain Falcon's side special has a ground to air transition animation similar to Ganondorf's to allow him to grab edges backwards.
     * Change Captain Falcon's up special throw animations were touched up

v2.6b[[64]edit]

     * Buff Aerial side special trigger box adjusted so that the hit connects more reliably once triggered

     * Buff Initial dash animation length increased by 1 frame to match Melee, improving moonwalk distance slightly
     * Nerf Turn grab animation is longer to match other turn grabs
     * Bug fix Fixed a bug on his Ledge Rolls that caused them to not free up the edge until the animations completely ended
     * Change Neutral special additional turns can be prevented by holding B.

v3.0[[65]edit]

     * Buff Side special landing lag slightly reduced if it connects with an opponent, now is the same for Side-B whiff or hit
     * Buff Falcon Kick is now B-reversible
     * Nerf Grounded Falcon Kick endlag is slightly longer

v3.01[[66]edit]

     * Buff Forward-Throw and Up-Throw have had their hitlag decreased
     * Buff Falcon Punch hitlag decreased

v3.5[[67]edit]

     * Buff Falcon Kick's recovery frames from ground to air reduced to special landing rather than hard landing.
     * Nerf Aerial Raptor Boost knockback reduced slightly.
     * Nerf Grounded Raptor Boost now requires the player to hold the reverse direction for Captain Falcon to grab the ledge after going offstage with it.
     * Change Falcon Kick knockback adjusted for its later hitboxes.
     * Change Falcon Dive knockback adjusted to use set character momentum instead of set knockback per character.
     * Change Up taunt has more IASA frames when facing right.
     * Change Air jump and Falcon Dive landing animations cleaned up.

v3.6 Beta[[68]edit]

     * Buff Powershield size multiplier: x0.73 → 0.75
     * Change Down aerial's nipple spike now has a fire element.
     * Change Up throw and down throw's properties match Melee throws better.
     * Nerf Aerial Raptor Boost has been reverted back to a meteor smash.
     * Change Aerial Falcon Kick's landing hitbox has the following changes:
          + Nerf Only hits grounded opponents.
          + Buff Damage: 6% → 10%
          + Nerf Knockback growth: 83 → 35
          + Nerf Hitbox size: 6 → 5

   Forward aerial [72]Knee Smash 18% (clean), 6% (late) Often simply referred to as "The Knee", Captain Falcon jabs a knee forward. During the initial frames, the entire hitbox acts as a powerful [73]Sex kick with electrical properties and great horizontal knockback.

If he hits an opponent on the ground, he launches a fiery uppercut, knocking them into the air. If he hits an opponent while in midair, he punches downward, meteor smashing them.

Restores his midair jump, making it a useful move for horizontal recovery at long distances.
   Final Smash [86]Blue Falcon 10% (car), 20% (ram), 10% (release) Captain Falcon calls in his F-Zero racer, the Blue Falcon. The opponent is hit by the vehicle as it zooms past, sending them to an unknown F-Zero track. Captain Falcon proceeds to run them down in the Blue Falcon, resulting in high knockback.
