   A [7]Party Ball breaks open releasing various items in [8]Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

          For the CPU Mode, see [9]ITEM.

   An item is an object, that either randomly appears on-stage during a match or is summoned by a character's [10]special move, that can be picked up and used by characters. Many items can be wielded once picked up, while others apply an effect, and almost all can be thrown at opponents. Items are a large part of the gameplay of the [11]Super Smash Bros. series, but problems with randomness and inconsistent risk/reward balance results in [12]tournament rulesets universally requiring that random spawning of items be disabled using the [13]Item Switch before starting the match.

   If all recovery items are turned off in [14]Super Smash Bros. Melee, the chance of naturally occurring items like the [15]apples dropped by [16]Whispy Woods on [17]Green Greens and [18]Chansey's [19]eggs recovering health is eliminated; the apples will all be projectiles and the eggs will either be explosives or drop other items. In [20]Super Smash Bros. Brawl the same is true regarding the apples (since Chansey does not appear). Additionally, the [21]vegetables on [22]Summit will not appear if [23]food is turned off.

Overview[[28]edit]

   Items appear from stage-dependent designated locations at various times throughout a match based on the frequency set in the [29]Item Switch. Characters can pick up items by standing near one and pressing the attack button; items can also be grabbed in midair starting in Melee with the grab button, or grabbed during dashes and aerial attacks in Brawl and SSB4. Characters can only hold one item at a time (if [30]Villager's [31]Pocket ability is discounted). If an item is left alone, it will eventually disappear, flashing briefly beforehand ([32]Pitfalls, [33]Green Shells and [34]Ore Clubs being exceptions). Items that are picked up by characters can be dropped or [35]thrown with the [36]grab button, and they may be dropped if the character takes a hard hit. The damage done by a thrown item depends on how fast it's moving. Most items can also be [37]swallowed in Brawl and SSB4, and in the latter, can even heal these characters when they do so, unless the item is an explosive.

Mechanics[[38]edit]

   In Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Melee, the chance of a character dropping their held item when hit is (hitbox damage)/60. Thus, if a hit deals 6% damage, the chance of it causing an item drop on a given frame is 10%. Roy’s fully charged [39]Flare Blade in Melee deals 50 damage, so it has a drop chance of 83.333%.

   In Brawl and Smash 4, this probability was decreased; normal items now use the formula CEIL(hitbox damage)/70. In addition, certain non-standard items use different formulas. In Brawl, this includes [40]Dragoon pieces and the [41]Smash Ball, where the drop chance = INT(hitbox damage)/50. In Smash 4, the chance of dropping each Dragoon piece was decreased to INT(hitbox damage)/100. This formula also applies to the [42]Daybreak. The [43]Master Ball item also has a non-standard drop chance, but the formula is not known.

Types of items[[44]edit]

   Items can be grouped into several categories based on their effects.
     * Container items release other items once broken open, which can be done either by attacking them or by picking up and throwing them. In general, container items have a 12.5% (1 in 8) chance of exploding instead of releasing items.
     * Battering items are wielded by characters once picked up, turning their [45]neutral attack, [46]forward tilt, [47]dash attack, and [48]forward smash into an item swipe.
     * Shooting items fire projectiles when used, typically replacing the neutral attack and [49]neutral aerial of the user. They all have limited ammunition and will merely shoot blanks once it runs out. In SSB4, trying to shoot an empty item will instead simply throw it.
     * Throwing items can only be thrown at opponents. Holding a throwing item means that a character cannot use most of their attacks, as pressing the attack button will simply throw the item.
     * Status items apply some sort of effect to the user, often beneficial but not necessarily. Some status items only need contact to be used (instead of needing to be grabbed). The ones that do need to be grabbed can be picked up even if the character is already holding an item; no such items exist in the original Super Smash Bros.
     * Recovery items decrease the [50]damage of the user (or increase their [51]HP in [52]Stamina mode). Starting in Melee, recovery items can be picked up even when the character is already holding an item.
     * Summoning items release an ally that fights along side you or your team when picked up.
     * Collectible items do not affect the match, but instead are added to the player's collection once picked up. They can be picked up even if the character is already holding an item. Computer players will not attempt to pick up collectible items, but if they do so accidentally they will not count.
     * Special items do not fit into the above categories.

   In addition to the above, certain items can be heavy, which limits those that pick them up into walking slowly (or not at all in SSB) and throwing. Only Donkey Kong can move quickly or jump while carrying a heavy item.

List of items[[53]edit]

   These items are available in the item switch menu. Some items like containers are grouped together, but the player can toggle all of these items on or off.
