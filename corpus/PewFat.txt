   [9]SFAT (left) and [10]PewPewU (right). Together, they are CLG|PewFat.

   PewFat is the name of one of the strongest doubles teams of the Modern Age of competitive [11]Super Smash Bros. Melee. The team consists of Kevin Toy ([12]PewPewU) and Zac Cordoni ([13]SFAT), two of the strongest Melee players in California. PewPewU would usually play [14]Marth while SFAT would usually play [15]Fox.

   The team was formed in 2010 with their first tournament being Don't Go Down There Jeff! in which they ended up placing at fourth. They would later make their national debut at [16]GENESIS 2 placing 9th out of 74 teams. Their first win in a doubles tournament was [17]Kings of Cali 2. However, their biggest accomplishment was winning the [18]EVO 2015 doubles side tourney taking the title over [19]Armada and [20]Ice. The team consistently places in Top 4 of the doubles events they enter.

   PewFat has starred in a Highlight Video known as "The Other Self - The Melee Which PewFat Plays" (edited by SSB_Lockon), which embraces how dominant their synergy is.

   In June 2015, PewPewU was signed by [21]Counter Logic Gaming while SFAT was signed later on in December in the same year.
