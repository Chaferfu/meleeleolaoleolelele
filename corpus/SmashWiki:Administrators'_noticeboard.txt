   The Administrators' noticeboard is intended to be a page to quickly alert the [22]administrators to issues that need their attention.

   To make a request or statement, create a new section and provide a neutral, precise summary of events with thought-out reasoning, and, if possible, links to any pages with relevant discussions. It is also a good idea to notify any users involved with the request with a link to the section on this page. Make sure to add new sections to the bottom.

   Report vandals and [23]sockpuppets at the top of the appropriate section labeled for such reports using {{IP|Username}}, where Username is the name of the user or the IP vandal's IP address.

   For reporting similar and unacceptable usernames, report them [24]here instead of on this page. This is done to keep the reports in one place, and because unacceptable usernames can be more subjective (unlike vandal/spam accounts), which may necessitate discussion (which the linked page will be more suited to handle).

Vandal/Spam account reports

   Admin note: Please adhere to [25]SW:QDV. Keep discussion to a minimum; an obvious bad-faith editor's record will speak for itself.

He uses a definition (which isn't an actual design guideline for Echo Fighters at all) provided solely by the Japanese Nintendo website which doesn't come from Sakurai himself and/or the official Smash Bros. website (which are the only reliable sources when it comes to Smash Bros. development), but from a "Planning Department Hiro P." from Nintendo Co., Ltd. who has absolutely no involvement in the actual development of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and uses it as an excuse to dismiss Dr. Mario, Young Link and Pichu (but especially Dr. Mario) from the label solely because they have different mobility physics, instead of the more logical explanation that they debuted in Melee. Mobility physics alone is not what makes a clone a clone as opposed to a semi-clone; it's moveset similarity that makes a clone a full clone. [829]Zakawer2 ([830]talk)
