   Fly Amanita is an American [22]smasher who [23]mains [24]Ice Climbers in [25]Melee, and is considered to be one of the best Ice Climbers players in the world, along with [26]ChuDat, [27]Nintendude, [28]dizzkidboogie, and [29]Wobbles. Fly Amanita was formerly ranked 30th on the [30]2015 SSBMRank and 1st on the [31]SoCal Melee Power Rankings. He is currently on hiatus to focus on his math doctorate.

   At [32]EVO 2014, Fly Amanita managed to place 7th in Melee singles. He defeated [33]Ice 2-1 and [34]Nintendude 2-0 in the winners' quarters pool before losing to [35]Armada 0-2, and then defeated [36]Chillin 2-0 in the losers' bracket to make into the top 8 bracket from losers'. In losers' top 8, he brought [37]PPMD down to the last stock of game 3, but eventually lost 1-2. Fly Amanita's best placing ever was at [38]Press Start placing 2nd losing 6-0 to [39]Mango.

   Fly Amanita is also a former member of the [40]Project M Backroom, having assisted in the new redesign of the [41]Ice Climbers. Despite this, he does not use the Ice Climbers in Project M tournaments, but rather uses [42]King Dedede instead. He is considered one of the best King Dedede players in the world, and placed 5th at [43]Apex 2014's Project M event using only him. He was formerly ranked 2nd on the SoCal Project M Power Rankings.

Playstyle[[50]edit]

   Fly Amanita has been well-known to not be proficient at [51]wobbling (although he will refuse to enter majors that ban wobbling out of principle, notably not attending [52]The Big House 4). Instead he uses technical down throw setups and combos. His [53]Sopo is also known to be one of the best in the world, famously clutching out a win against [54]Silent Wolf at [55]Kings of Cali 3. He is also known for his prowess in the [56]Marth matchup only losing to [57]Ken, [58]Azen, [59]PewPewU, and [60]The Moon.
