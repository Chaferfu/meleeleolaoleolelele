   PewPewU uses Fox in a lot of specific matchups and it makes me angry that people keep on removing Fox from his melee mains section. He actually always uses Fox against Mew2King since Evo 2014 and also uses Fox sometimes while playing with SFAT in doubles since Evo 2014. He has even done a few tournaments with just Fox. I know he doesn't use Fox near as much as Marth, which is why I put Fox after Marth. He uses Fox alongside his Marth instead of like sandbagging which he does with his Falco.

          "He actually always uses Fox against Mew2King since Evo 2014." This is entirely fabricated, because they haven't even played in tournament since EVO 2014. On top of that, the characters some players use in doubles do not always apply to singles. The fact of the matter is that PPU is far more likely to use solo Marth than he is to use Marth and Fox. (You also went out of your way to add Fox next to his name for tournaments where he DID use solo Marth.)
          Also, the "Other" section doesn't need to only be for "sandbagging" characters. Armada formerly used Young Link as a genuine counterpick to Hungrybox/Jigglypuff players in general, but no one would ever claim it was anything more than a secondary. The same should apply to PPU and Fox. [10]PokemonMasterJamal3 ([11]talk) 20:10, 12 May 2016 (EDT)
