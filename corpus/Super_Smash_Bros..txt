Opening movie[[64]edit]

   The [65]opening movie in Super Smash Bros., unlike later games in the Super Smash Bros. series, completely lacks pre-rendered footage, instead opting to render everything in real-time.

   When the opening movie starts, two random [66]starter characters are chosen to be placed by [67]Master Hand on top of a desk, which transitions to a scenery resembling [68]Peach's Castle. This process is repeated every time the opening movie is played.

   At the end of the opening movie, the figures of the four [69]unlockable characters are quickly shown against a white background. If a character hasn't been unlocked, it will simply be shown as a silhouette; reversely, they will be deobfuscated once unlocked.

   After this, the opening movie directly segues into the title screen, a trend which would be followed by future installments, along with the [70]announcer calling out the game's title.

Characters[[72]edit]

   There are twelve playable [73]characters in Super Smash Bros., eight of which are available from the [74]start, and four of which are [75]unlockable.

   The most amount of slots are given to the [76]Mario and [77]Pokémon universes with each getting two characters: [78]Mario alongside his brother [79]Luigi, and [80]Pikachu and [81]Jigglypuff, respectively, with the latter characters in both universes being unlockable.

   Two more slots are given to reoccurring Mario characters [82]Donkey Kong and [83]Yoshi as representatives of their sub-universes, [84]Donkey Kong and [85]Yoshi respectively.

   The remaining starter characters are [86]Link, [87]Samus, [88]Kirby and [89]Fox from [90]The Legend of Zelda, [91]Metroid, [92]Kirby and [93]Star Fox universes respectively. Along with Luigi and Jigglypuff, two more characters are unlockable, being [94]Ness and [95]Captain Falcon from the [96]EarthBound and [97]F-Zero universes respectively.

[206]Tournament play[[207]edit]

   Main article: [208]Tournament legal (SSB)

   Unlike its successors, Super Smash Bros. never enjoyed a large professional competitive scene in North America. However, interest in the game has been renewed in recent years with the popularity of its sequels. Players can play Super Smash Bros. online through [209]Kaillera using the [210]Project64k emulator. Recently, there have been more and more tournaments of Super Smash Bros. due to an influx of new players. Most Super Smash Bros. tournaments are paired up with Melee events and most (offline) SSB tournaments are located in California, Canada, New Jersey or Peru.

   The standard tournament rules differ little from that of Melee. The most common standard tournament rules are as follows:
     * The required number of victories to win are generally the best of 3 matches; the only exceptions are finals, in which the number of matches is 5 or 7.
     * Double eliminations are in place.
     * 4 [211]stock with a 8-minute time limit, if it is possible; the original game does not support placing a time limit on stock matches, but emulators and [212]mods can implement one.
     * [213]Items are disabled.
     * [214]Handicaps are off.
     * The first match is played on Dream Land.

     * For the first match, characters are chosen double-blind - at the same time, so that neither player knows their opponent's character beforehand.
     * Players may re-pick [215]characters after each match. However, the loser of each match gets to pick last (known as slob picks).

Development[[216]edit]

   [217]Masahiro Sakurai was interested in making a fighting game for four players. His initial design for the game was called Kakuto-Geemu Ryuoh ([218]Dragon King: The Fighting Game)^[219][1], which featured simple characters. After presenting the game to co-worker [220]Satoru Iwata, he helped Sakurai continue on with the project. Sakurai understood that many fighting games did not sell well, so he tried to make his game original.^[221][1] His first idea was to include famous Nintendo characters and put them into the fray.^[222][1] Knowing he would not get permission to do so, Sakurai created a prototype of the game without sanction from Nintendo and did not inform them until he was sure the game was well-balanced.^[223][1] The prototype he presented featured [224]Mario, [225]Donkey Kong, [226]Samus Aran, and [227]Fox McCloud as playable characters. The idea was later approved.^[228][1]^[229][2]

   Super Smash Bros. features music from some of Nintendo's most popular gaming franchises. While many tracks are new arrangements for the game, some songs are taken directly from their sources. The music for Super Smash Bros. was composed by Hirokazu Ando, who later returned as sound and music director for [230]Super Smash Bros. Melee. A [231]complete soundtrack was released on CD in Japan through Teichiku Records in 2001.^[232][3]

   IGN "Best Fighting Game"

   Super Smash Bros. was a commercial success, selling 5 million copies worldwide with 2.93 million sold in the United States and 1.97 million copies sold in Japan. It was the 5th best selling game for the [240]Nintendo 64. Reviews were mostly positive, with many critics praising the game's addictive and fun multiplayer gameplay and simple controls, but it was criticized as well, mainly due to the game's lack of content and somewhat limited single player mode.

Differences from later Super Smash Bros. games[[249]edit]

   Super Smash Bros. is the only game in the series with the following distinctions:
     * Using the phrases "Game Set" and "Time Up" in matches in all regions. Later games use the phrases "Game!" and "Time!" in the English version, while each one still uses "Game Set" and "Time Up" in the Japanese version.
     * Lacking stages from the [250]F-Zero and [251]EarthBound universes.
     * Introducing new characters from the [252]Yoshi and [253]F-Zero universes.
     * Not having [254]Bowser as the heaviest character, as he did not make his first playable appearance until Melee. Rather, the heaviest character is [255]Donkey Kong.
     * Featuring only playable protagonists. However, two characters had previously appeared as antagonists -- [256]Donkey Kong in [257]Donkey Kong, its [258]Game & Watch counterpart, Donkey Kong 3 and Donkey Kong (Game Boy), and [259]Mario in Donkey Kong Jr. and Donkey Kong Circus.
     * Being rated "E" for Everyone by the ESRB, as its successors [260]Super Smash Bros. Melee and [261]Super Smash Bros. Brawl would be rated "T" for Teen, and [262]Super Smash Bros. 4 and [263]Super Smash Bros. Ultimate would be rated "E10+" for players who are aged ten and over. As a result, it is also the only game not to share its ESRB rating with another game in the franchise.
     * Showing the stage's 3D model when highlighted on the Stage Selection screen, as well as restricting the cursor to the squares depicting the stage.
     * Not having Battlefield and Final Destination as normally playable stages.
     * Not allowing characters to grab ledges from behind in any way.
     * Not include [264]Side special moves moves, as these would be added in later games.

Trivia[[265]edit]

     * The starting eight characters are placed in the order of when they first appeared in their respective debut titles on the character selection screen, starting with the oldest, [266]Mario and [267]Donkey Kong, and ending with the most recent, [268]Pikachu. This same order is used when listing the cast of the original Super Smash Bros. in later games, such as when organizing [269]trophies. This chronological ordering also applies to the four unlockable characters on the character selection screen, though this is only relative to each other and not the other characters.
     * Super Smash Bros. marks the first appearances of [270]Samus, [271]Kirby, and [272]Ness in 3D.
          + Additionally, this game is the only [273]Nintendo 64 title in which Samus or Ness appears.
     * This game has the least amount of [274]unlockable characters, at four, and also has the least amount of [275]unlockable stages (out of games that have them), at [276]one.
     * This game is one of two that uses 2D illustrations on the box art, alongside [277]Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
     * If the player achieves No Miss x11 at the end of classic mode, on the victory screen the announcer will say "Incredible!" instead of congratulations.
