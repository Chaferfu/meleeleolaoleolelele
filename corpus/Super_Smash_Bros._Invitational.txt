   The Super Smash Bros. Invitational was a [17]Super Smash Bros. for Wii U tournament hosted by [18]Nintendo. To commemorate the release of Super Smash Bros. 4, and the Super Smash Bros. series as a whole, Nintendo [19]announced and subsequently hosted the tournament during [20]E3 2014, at the [21]NOKIA Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The host of the event was [22]Geoff Keighley^[23][1], while [24]Reggie Fils-Aime made an additional appearance at the conclusion at the event to present the winner with a trophy.

   The game played was [25]Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, marking the first time that the game was playable to the public. Sixteen top professional players, whose experience included [26]Super Smash Bros. Melee, [27]Super Smash Bros. Brawl and even [28]Project M, were invited to participate. Intended to be more an exhibition of the game than a standard tournament, the event featured some non-standard rules, such as the inclusion of items in some matches, in order to demonstrate multiple aspects of gameplay that were previously unrevealed.

   The tournament had 3,000 in-person spectators, with costumed fans receiving priority seating;^[29][2] all spectators were given flipboards with the official art of all playable characters in order to vote on who their favourite player in a match was.

   The entirety of the tournament was also streamed live on Nintendo's [30]official Twitch account, with professional Smash commentators announcing and commentating both the live event and video footage.

   [31]A video contest was also held prior to the contest, where the winner of which would be awarded a VIP trip to the event and have the opportunity to play one of the tournament winners. The winner was revealed to be [32]justinanthonylennox.

Ruleset[[181]edit]

   The following rules were in effect:^[182][5]
     * Before the tournament began, all competitors chose characters in random order. Characters could not be chosen by multiple players, and players could not switch characters midway through the tournament.
     * Each match was a four player free-for-all, with all players having four [183]stocks, as well as a five minute [184]timer. The top two players in terms of score advanced. A tie between two players was decided by which player [185]KOed more players; if this was insufficient, the tie would then be broken by fan vote.
     * The finals took place on [186]Battlefield, with both players having four stocks and the time at 8 minutes, as an explicit homage to the competitive Smash community.
     * [187]Items were on medium for round 1, low for rounds 2 and 3, and off for the final.
